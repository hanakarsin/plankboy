Standard, Linear, and Dynamic.</p><p>The Response Curve basically changes the amount of movement on your screen in response to the stick movement that you input.&nbsp; So the Standard Curve will basically feel like other Call of Duty games.&nbsp; When you flick or press the stick in one direction the amount that you press the stick away from 0 will make the actual movement x percent of that number.&nbsp; While the Linear option is basically not having any variable.&nbsp; If you move your stick 50% the screen moves 50% the max speed of the sensitivity settings.</p><h3>Aim Assist</h3><p>There are actually four options in the Aim Assist category for the controller in Modern Warfare.&nbsp; There are three different auto aim settings, and I think these definitely cater to your experience level with shooters in general.&nbsp; If you’re playing on console, aim assist is pretty much a must.&nbsp; So we do not recommend turning this off as no controller is going to be easy to aim with without aim assist.&nbsp; While there are people that like it, finding one of the different assistance settings would probably be better.</p><p>The other three settings are: Standard, Precision, and Focusing.&nbsp; If you’ve been playing COD for awhile and you’re just looking to fine tune your settings you’ll probably want to stay focused on either the standard Aim Assist or the Precision Aim Assist.&nbsp; Focusing is probably only for those that are new with the controller as it has a strong aim slowdown.&nbsp; Standard is going to be what you’ve come to expect from Call of Duty aim assists in the past, while precision is going to be better for players that are already accurate players as the aim assist doesn’t kick in until you are aiming closer to the target.</p><h3>Vibration</h3><p>The last controller option consideration is going to be vibration.&nbsp; I can tell you that if you’re talking about competitive Call of Duty most professional players do not use vibration when they play.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Well, there are different reasons.&nbsp; Some like the lighter controller.&nbsp; Others think that vibration can throw off your shot.&nbsp; Whatever the case, going from playing with vibration to playing without it and vice a versa can be hard.&nbsp; We suggest you pick one way or the other and stick to it.</p><h3>Our Settings</h3><ul><li>Button Layout – Default</li><li>Horizontal Stick Sens – 8</li><li>Vertical Stick Sens – 8</li><li>ADS Low – .75</li><li>ADS High – .75</li><li>Aim Response Curve – Standard</li><li>Controller Vibration – Off</li><li>Aim Assist – Precision</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for a preset to start with 8 on the Horizontal and Vertical Sens might feel a little high.&nbsp; Try bumping up from default to 6 with these other settings for a nice snappy feel for aiming and shooting.</p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZpyZnKF6sLKMnaytsV2ivKWx0adksJmim66zsYybnKysXZi8r8DRqKOlnaJiwKbA06KloKtf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-best-controller-settings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-best-controller-settings.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-best-controller-settings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-best-controller-settings.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-best-controller-settings.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-best-controller-settings.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/cookie-run-kingdom-holiday-express-answers-for-chapter-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/cookie-run-kingdom-holiday-express-answers-for-chapter-2.html>Cookie Run Kingdom Holiday Express Answers for Chapter 2</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/bg3-sarins-skull-location-how-to-solve-the-sarin-skeleton-puzzle.html>BG3 Sarin's Skull Location: How to Solve the Sarin Skeleton Puzzle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/bg3-sarins-skull-location-how-to-solve-the-sarin-skeleton-puzzle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
