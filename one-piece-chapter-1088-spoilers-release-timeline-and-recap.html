This left fans eagerly awaiting what happened next, and let me tell you, the long break was worth the wait! After reading One Piece 1087, you may be dying to know the release date of Chapter 1088. Or the chapter was so hyped that you are looking for One Piece Chapter 1088 spoilers, so you don’t have to wait until the official release. This is understandable because One Piece Chapter 1087 ends with a closely matched battle between Garp and Kuzan but doesn’t bring it to its conclusion, leaving us to wonder if either will die or what will happen. Here’s everything you need to know about One Piece Chapter 1088.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>One Piece Chapter 1088 Spoilers</h2><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=51 data-injectable=false>One Piece Chapter 1088 spoilers have been released:</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Chapter 1088: “The Last Lesson”</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>One Piece Live-Action series special color spread! We can see Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji in the front (in a fighting pose) and the faces of Shanks, Koby, Buggy, Kuro, Garp, Mihawk, Arlong, and Krieg (or Smoker, not 100% sure) in the background. The sentence “tomorrow studio x Netflix” zppears too.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Chapter starts with a flashback in the old Marineford. Garp is teaching a class for new marines. Koby is in the class too, it’s his first lesson (he has the same appearance as in East Blue arc). Garp asks a question to all new marines.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Garp: “If 1 baby and 1 old man get stranded on an island, and you have a boat that can hold only 2 people… Who would you save?”</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Koby: “I would get down from the boat myself, so both of them can live.”</p><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=26 data-injectable=false>Garp throws chalk at Koby.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Garp: “You are wrong! The old man doesn’t have much time left anyway, so you just let him die! Why did you all become Marines? Isn’t it to protect the people’s “future”? Then, you and the baby have more of a future than the old man. Only you and the baby must live on!!”</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>After the lesson, Garp is scolded by a Marine instructor. He asks Garp to never teach such things again, since all people’s lives are equal, but Garp disagrees.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=60 data-injectable=false>Garp: “The future of young people is limitless!”</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Then we cut another flashback at Amazon Lily, after Boa Hancock’s incident some days ago. Blackbeard agrees to leave Amazon Lily, however he’s taking 800 Marines and a battleship with him. Vice Admiral Yamajaki only stands and watches since “Marine HQ” didn’t give permission to fight a Yonkou.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>However, Koby steps up and offers Blackbeard to take him as prisoner instead of his men. Vice Admiral Yamakaji allows him to do it since Koby is a SWORD member.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>Back to present we see everyone on Garp’s battleship is panicking, so they shoot at the giant hand, but cannot stop it.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Koby: “If that hand comes down, hundreds of lives will be lost!!

Pirates are laughing, thinking Koby, Helmeppo, and Grus can’t do anything without Garp.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Grus asks Koby why Garp entrusted him with destroying the giant hand. He wonders if Koby has a bomb or something like that to destroy it. Koby replies he doesn’t have any weapon, but he will try to do something.</p><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false>Pirates shoot at them, Helmeppo blocks a bullet with his sword and gets caught in an explosion.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Garp stands up and faces Kuzan. He punches Kuzan to the ground, moving so fast that Kuzan is surprised. Then Garp jumps on the roof towards the skull and attacks it.</p><p data-characters=34 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Garp: “Galaxy Divide!”</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Pizzaro: “Ugyaaaaa~~~!!!”</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>Garp uses a massive attack that splits the skull in two, making Pizarro’s real body heavily injured with blood coming out of his head. Grus and Koby follow Garp.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>Grus: “What will you do, Koby?”</p><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Koby: “I won’t let it fall down!”</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Koby then jumps into the air facing Pizarro’s giant hand. Pizzaro is in pain, but he can still move, so he swings his hand down to crush Garp’s battleship in revenge.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Then another flashback starts, back to the time when Koby and Helmeppo joined the Marines.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>We see Garp and Helmeppo talking in the training field that we saw on the cover story. Garp noticed that Koby manages to improve very fast, but he has an abnormal amount of injuries on his hands and shoulders.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Helmeppo says Koby doesn’t want him to tell anyone, but the fact is that Koby knows he has less fighting skills than a normal person. TO make up for it, he needs to train between 100-200 times harder than other people.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Helmeppo says Koby has been training secretly every night by punching Garp’s “battleship bag.”</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Cut to present, Garp is smiling while he remembers that training. All pirates are laughing at Koby, saying there’s no way he can stop the giant hand. Pirates say too the “Hero” title must have gotten into his head.</p><p data-characters=39 data-current-count=39 data-injectable=false>Koby is about to attack the giant hand.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>Koby: “If I can’t do this, everyone will die because me…”</p><p data-characters=39 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Koby uses: “Honesty Impact”</p><p data-characters=33 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>Pizarro: “Owaaa~~~h!”</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Koby punches and destroys the entire giant arm in an epic double spread (we can see black lightning from the impact). We see that Pizarro is screaming in pain as his real arm is breaking.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Garp is laughing in tears while both Helmeppo and Grus are shocked. Grus uses a technique called “Clay Web” to create a giant clay net to stop the falling stones and save Garp’s battleship. Koby, Helmeppo, and Grus end up safely on the battleship.</p><p data-characters=59 data-current-count=59 data-injectable=false>Garp calls everyone on the battleship with a Den Den Mushi.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Garp: “All of you, full speed ahead and sail away from “Hachinosu right now!

Garp continues.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Garp: “All of you are the “future of the Marines”!”</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>In the last double spread, Garp is lying on the ground with an ice blad stabbed on his chest. He’s surrounded by all Blackbeard Pirates and Kuzan.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Garp is still laughing as ice is spreading from his wound.

After saving Koby from an ambush, Garp is injured by a cheap shot from Shiryu. With Garp being injured, the Blackbeard Pirates continue to attack him. During this time, the chapter reveals that Garp’s bounty is worth 3 Crowns (3,000 million Berries). The two fighters then clash with their Haki and are thrown back. The chapter ends with a severely injured Garp, and we wonder about Kuzan’s fate. Despite this, many fan theories explore the potential consequences of what may happen to Garp and Kuzan in the future. Finally, at the end of the chapter, Avalo Pizarro brings two massive arms from the island with his powers and is about to crush Garp’s ship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>One Piece Chapter 1088 Predications: Who Garp Live? Will Kuzan Die?</h2><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>I don’t think Garp will die. The manga hasn’t set up his death like it did with Whitebeard’s heroic last stand. However, his injuries in Chapter 1087 may prevent him from annihilating entire islands of people on the front lines. This could lead to him being assigned to a different role, making him less of a threat in the long run.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>In my opinion, Kuzan’s fate in the upcoming chapters is uncertain, but I believe he may not survive. The most convincing theory is that Kuzan will pass on his fruit to Koby before he dies. This gesture symbolizes the passing on of the legacy as Kuzan is Garp’s most skilled student. The theory gains more credibility as Kuzan’s act of saving the ship and enabling their escape may be seen as treason by the Black Beard pirates, leading to his demise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>One Piece Chapter 1088 Release Timeline</h2><p>One Piece Chapter 1088</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>The One Piece Chapter 1088 release timeline is&nbsp;<strong>1:00 AM JST&nbsp;on&nbsp;Monday, July 24, 2023</strong>.
