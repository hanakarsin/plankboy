Grab the Hydroculus up there.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #17</h3><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>This Hydroculus is easy enough to find. Just use the Waverider or swim to it on the water’s surface.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #18</h3><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>For the next Hydroculus, dive underwater and you’ll find it in the center of a rocky arch.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #19</h3><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>There’s a puzzle near this Hydroculus, but it’s a red herring. Dive underwater and head to the small ruin with a locked chest and a blue Pneuma block. The Hydroculus is inside the ruin. Just swim through one of the small openings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #20</h3><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>The twentieth Hydroculus is located in the southeastern part of the Court of Fontaine. You can find it floating along one of the Aquabus rail lines that leads southeast out of the city.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #21</h3><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>The next Hydroculus is located atop the highest point in the southern half of the Court of Fontaine. Thankfully, there’s no need to climb since there’s a watery orb at the foot of the tower that will launch you all the way to the top.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #22</h3><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>This Hydroculus is located underground in the Institute of Natural Philosophy. Teleport to the waypoint and head west. In the corner of the nearby room, there’s an enemy that shoots projectiles at you. Absorb the power from one of the crabs and then use it to reflect the projectile back at the enemy. When it’s destroyed, it will drop a Hydroculus.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #23</h3><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>The next Hydroculus is also in the Institute of Natural Philosophy.

It’s locked behind a bubble barrier with a chest. Like most barriers, you can remove it by bringing all of the nearby Seelies to their respective pedestals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #34</h3><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>For this Hydroculus, head directly above the previous one. Then, cut the seaweed attached to the flying machine on the water’s surface. Once it’s free, climb aboard and activate it so it can carry you to the Hydroculus in the sky.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #35</h3><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>This Hydroculus takes you back to land.

To reach it, dive into the water below and solve the red door puzzle (which leads you to the next Hydroculus described below). Then, a water cannon will appear on top of the building that you can use to launch yourself directly to this Hydroculus.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #39</h3><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>This Hydroculus is located underwater just off the coast of the Opera Epiclese. There’s a building with a red barrier preventing entry. The Hydroculus is inside. To open the barrier, absorb the power from a nearby crab and then use the shield to help the balls make it into their respective rings. You’ll have to break some rocks to reveal the necessary water currents. With the rings activated, you can activate the switches to open the door.</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>How to Unlock the Underground Court of Fontaine Teleport Waypoint in Genshin Impact</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hydroculus #40</h3><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>This Hydroculus is floating underwater guarded by the Fairy Knight Twins Angelica and Medoro.
