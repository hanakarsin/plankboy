My Hero Academia</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/My-Hero-Academia-Season-6.jpg><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true><a href=#>My Hero Academia</a> is one of the most popular anime out right now, and it’s a series that achieves the rare feat of staying true to the Shonen formula while adding new elements to the mix.

Naruto</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Naruto-Watch-Order-1.jpg><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=true>When it comes to anime that can capture the underdog essence of Black Clover, none stands taller than the rambunctious middle child of the Shonen Big Three, Naruto. Masashi Kushimoto’s magnum opus follows the titular ninja, who had the misfortune of having the demonic Nine-Tailed Fox sealed inside him as an infant. Shunned for most of his childhood, Naruto strives to become the Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, and finally gain the recognition and acceptance of his community.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=false>The plot of Naruto hits many of the same beats that define that of Black Clover: an underdog protagonist, a world with a built-in power system, themes of friendship, and a powerful story that explores the complex and messy history of a world dominated by ancient and often misguided customs that define one’s worth to society. If you’re a fan of Black Clover looking for a new show to sink your teeth into, look no further than Naruto.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
