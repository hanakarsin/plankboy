Of course, there have also been numerous class changes which is where the interesting information awaits. The official information has been observed on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lodestone patch notes page</a> but it has been rewrote here for ease of access.</p><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get Immutable Solution in FFXIV</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Class/Job Changes for PVP</h3><figure class=wp-block-table data-found-rows=10 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true><table><tr><th>Job</th><th>Action(s)</th><th>Changes</th></tr><tbody readability=30><tr readability=3><td><strong>Paladin</strong></td><td>Holy Sheltron</td><td>The <strong>damage that you can inflict</strong> if the barrier hadn’t been absorbed has been altered to <strong>include 100% of the barrier’s remaining potency</strong>.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td><strong>Bard</strong></td><td>Silent Nocturne, The Warden’s Paean, Apex Arrow, and Repelling Shot</td><td><strong>The potency of both Apex Arrow and Repelling Shot have been increased by 2000</strong>. Silent Nocturne’s potency has been reduced by 2000 with its range reduced by 10 and the duration brought down by 1 second. We thought this reduction was a large nerf to the action. <strong>The Warden’s Paean action has reduced damage taken during the effect by an extra 5%</strong> along with the HP recovered upped by 5%. I personally love this particular change.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td><strong>Red Mage</strong></td><td>Enchanted Riposte, Enchanted Redoublement, and Enchanted Zwerchhau</td><td>Added “Barrier potency is increased by 10% when target is afflicted with Monomachy” to all three of the actions.</td></tr><tr readability=11><td><strong>Dragoon</strong></td><td>Wyrmwind Thrust, Horrid Roar, Heavens’ Thrust, High Jump, and<br>Sky Shatter</td><td>The Potency of both Horrid Roar and Heavens’ Thrust have been increased by 2000. Whereas players may not have expected to see a reduction in potency for Sky Shatter by 2000 and for High Jump by 1000. Along with this,<strong> Wrmwind Thrusts Potency potential will now start at 8000 instead of 4000</strong>.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Sage</strong></td><td>Toxikon and Toxikon II</td><td>Both actions have had their effect duration upped by one second, making it last for six seconds in total now.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Machinist</strong></td><td>Chain Saw and Bioblaster</td><td>Overall Damage Potency of Chain Saw has been reduced by 4000 but the potency is increased by 50% when your target’s HP is below 50%. <strong>Bioblaster’s Potency is doubled if the Analysis effect is applied to you</strong>.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Samurai</strong></td><td>Hissatsu: Chiten</td><td>The Kuzushi effect duration has been increased an extra second.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Monk</strong></td><td>Thunderclap and Enlightenment</td><td>Wind Resonance effect has been increased by five seconds for Thunderclap. Along with that, Englightment’s additional damage has been reduced by 4000.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td><strong>Reaper</strong></td><td>Grim Swathe and Soul Slice</td><td>Soul Slice now has had the recast time reduced by five seconds which we know players will be happy about. Grim Swathe on the other hand has had the maximum stacks of Soul Reaver reduced by one which will keep things balanced. <strong>Reaper has also had the new Guillotine action added</strong>. However, “Gibbet” and “Gallows” actions have been removed instead.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td><strong>Ninja</strong></td><td>Seiton Tenchu and Bunshin</td><td>Bunshin’s <strong>effect duration has been reduced by 10 seconds</strong> and Seiton Tenchu’s time for filling the limit gauge has been increased from 90 seconds to 105 seconds overall.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The biggest reveals from Final Fantasy XVI’s PlayStation State of Play</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Extra PVP Changes with Patch 6.4</h3><p data-characters=11 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false><strong>Frontlines:</strong></p><ul data-found-items=12 data-items-injection=true data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true><li data-index=0>Adjustments for Limit Gauge Buildup, damage taken, and damage dealt modifiers.</li><li data-index=1>Limp status won’t be applied to any players that are attacked on a mount.
