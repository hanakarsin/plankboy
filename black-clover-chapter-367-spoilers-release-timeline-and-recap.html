As Asta said his goodbyes and thanked the Hino Country people for all their help, Finral arrived to pick up Asta.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=true>While Asta seemed happy to see Finral, Shogun Ryuya Ryudo had something more important to ask him. Ryuya knew one more person could join Asta and go to the Clover Kingdom. Hence he suggested Finral take Ichika with them. Ichika initially rejected this idea as she believed that her place was with Ryuya. That’s when Yosuga Mushogatake assured Ichika that he would protect the Shogun and the Hino Country. Ryuya added to this and told Ichika to go to the Clover Kingdom and reunite with her older brother Yami Sukehiro.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Chapter 366 returns to the present time with Asta arriving at the Clover Kingdom. He was left angry upon seeing his Magic Knight squad mates beaten and in such a sorry state. That’s when Damnatio tried to intimidate him. However, Asta felt confident in himself when he asked Finral to focus on medical treatment while taking on the Paladin alone.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>Asta whipped out his Demon Slasher Katana, walking toward Damnatio to fight him. He was confident that he would win and was left unfazed by Damnatio’s threats. Damnatio used his Air Magic to pass judgment on Asta. However, Asta canceled it out using his Anti-Magic. Damnatio was left surprised by this as Finral could understand that Asta had become more adept at using Anti-Magic.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>Asta remarked Damnatio’s magic to be very incompatible with his Anti-Magic. Following that, he questioned Damnatio’s morals as he contradicted his statements about justice and peace. Right after, Black Clover chapter 366 spoilers showed Asta slashing Damnatio using his Zetten.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Clover Chapter 366 Fan Thoughts</h2><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Some fans complain that Asta’s Anti-Magic is overpowered and leaves no one to match him. However, don’t forget that his anti-magic gets negated by magic that’s stronger than it, which is why it needs to be comparable in strength to the magic it negates. Due to Asta’s ki training, the anti-magical power he can produce now is far more robust than before.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Furthermore, fans have expressed their dissatisfaction that Asta defeating Damnatio renders the Black Bull’s efforts meaningless and insignificant. However, it is important to consider a few things:</p><ul data-found-items=4 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false><li>The situation had some merit as it led to Damnatio resorting to using devil magic.</li><li>The Black Bull’s plan was not to defeat Damnatio, but to delay him until Asta arrives.</li><li>Without the magic boost from Yuno, the Black Bulls were able to defeat the angel minions, leaving Damnatio alone.</li><li>Lucius is much stronger than Damnatio. If Asta had difficulty fighting against Damnatio, he might not have been prepared to take on Lucius. With the Manga nearing its conclusion, there are likely only a handful of individuals who could pose a challenge to Asta, which is the natural progression.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><span>Black Clover Chapter 367 Release Timeline</span></h2><p>Black Clover Chapter 367</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>The Black Clover Chapter 367 release timeline is&nbsp;<strong>1:00 AM JST</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>Monday, August 7</strong>, 2023.
