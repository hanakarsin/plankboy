Instead of a standard catalyst, he will wave his cane to deal Hydro damage</strong>. His Charged Attack, on the other hand, will be the main pillar of his set and will have two variants, the standard one and Equitable Judgment.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Neuvillette Charged Attacks, Explained</h3><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Differently from all the characters currently in the game, <strong>Neuvillette’s charged attack will have an empowering mechanic called Legal Evaluation, which will allow you to hold the charged attack button in order for Neuvilette to create a Seal of Arbitration.</strong></p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true><strong>Once the seal is formed, Neuvilette will then perform his enhanced charged attack, Equitable Judgment,</strong> and thus unleash torrents of Hydro directly ahead of him. The torrents will deal massive AoE Hydro damage based on his HP and won’t expend his stamina. If his HP value is higher than 50%, performing the attack will also steadily consume his own HP.</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=88 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Genshin Impact Nintendo Switch Port: Release Date, Trailer, Gameplay, and Leaks</a></p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>On the other hand, <strong>unleashing the charged attack prematurely will allow Neuvilette to perform his standard CA</strong> — in which he will expend Stamina in order to hit enemies with a ring of water dealing AoE DMG.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>While holding his charged attack, Neuvillette will be able to move freely and will absorb any Sorcewater Droplets generated by his Elemental Skill in an AoE.

For each opponent hit, the Skill will then generate three Sorcewater Droplets near its location, all of which can be absorbed in order to perform Equitable Judgment.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>At set intervals, the Waterfall generated by O Tears, I Shall Repay will produce a Spiritbreath Thorn, which will deal Pneuma-aligned Hydro DMG to all targets in an AoE based on Neuvilette’s ATK.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Elemental Burst, Explained</h3><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false><strong>Neuvilette’s Elemental Skill, O Tears, I Shall Repay, will allow him to produce a giant wave dealing AoE Hydro DMG based on his overall HP.</strong> After taking the field, the Wave will then generate two Waterfalls that will deal AoE Hydro damage based on his HP and then generate a total of 6 Sorcewater Droplets.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Genshin Impact Barbara DPS Build | How to Build Barbara as Top Tier Elemental DPS</a></p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>Although no videos showcasing his abilities were revealed, you can check out Neuvillette’s leaked splash art &nbsp;—which showcases his Hydro cane— below, also courtesy of Mero:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>All Neuvillette’s Talents and Constellations, Explained</h3><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false><strong>Neuvillette’s first Talent, Her to The Ancient Sea’s Legacy, will allow him to gain one stack of Past Draconic Glories after your party triggers any kind of Hydro-related elemental reaction.</strong></p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false><strong>Past Draconic Glories will then increase the damage of Equitable Judgment by 110%,130%, and 160%</strong>.
