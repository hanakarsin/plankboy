Players can take on the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a member of the Japanese Yakuza who gets imprisoned for ten years over something he didn’t do. Upon release, he discovers a major incident and decides to protect a young girl believed to have a connection to the case. He eventually earns the respect of the people around him.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Despite its unpolished mechanics, this game was praised for its storyline and character development and is a must for all who want to know the series well.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza 2 (2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-2-2008.jpg><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>This is the second entry to the franchise and a direct sequel to the first game. It still centers on Kazuma Kiryu’s involvement in the criminal underworld. This time, Kiryu’s former group, the Tojo Clan of eastern Japan, asked him to help in their relationship with the Omi Alliance group from western Japan. He becomes an adoptive father to an orphan named Haruka, learns more about his own past, and becomes a rival to someone from Omi.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>Yakuza 2 improved on the main game’s combat mechanics and added a few new elements like romance. It’s another must-have for fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Like a Dragon Arrives! (2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/like-a-dragon-arrives-2008.jpg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>A Japan-only PS3 release, Like a Dragon Arrives! is a period-drama-themed spin-off for the series and focuses on another character and period of time. The game highlights parts of Musashi Miyamoto’s life during the Edo period in Japanese history. Hence, it features character designs and settings reminiscent of the said era.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>While the gameplay doesn’t deviate much from the first two entries, it does introduce new mechanics such as a new item storage system. This is not necessary to understand the main game but is still worth the attention.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza 3 (2010)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-3-2010.jpg><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>The direct sequel to Yakuza 2, Yakuza 3 again puts the spotlight on Kazuma Kiryu as he’s pulled back into the Japanese criminal underworld despite running an orphanage along with his adoptive daughter Haruka. He clashes with some powerful people who want to turn the land where the orphanage stands into a seaside resort.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>This is the first Yakuza game on the PS3, and it took advantage of the technology to introduce new mechanics. It also features a new storyline that Yakuza fans shouldn’t miss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Panther: Like a Dragon New Chapter (2010)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/black-panther-like-a-dragon-new-chapter-2010.jpg><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Another Japan-only release, Black Panther: Like a Dragon New Chapter was the first Yakuza game to be made available for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). It follows the story of an aimless youth named Tatsuya Ukyo, who gets framed for an incident that left a young boy in comatose.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>While its combat system is drastically different from earlier Yakuza games, Black Panther: Like a Dragon New Chapter’s core gameplay largely remained the same. Those interested in the main Yakuza storyline won’t need to get this, but it won’t hurt to play it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza 4 (2011)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-4-2011.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>This direct sequel to Yakuza 4 welcomes three new characters into the fray. Kazuma Kiryu is joined by protagonists Shun Akiyama, Masayoshi Tanimura, and Taiga Saejima, in a plot that has many twists and turns. Each character has a unique fighting style due to their backgrounds and will require players to master their moves.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Yakuza 4 also has mini-games, and some side quests or goals that are specific to each character. There are also some extra activities that will reward players with trophies for completing them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza: Dead Souls (2012)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-dead-souls-2012.jpg><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>This spin-off has no connection to the original Yakuza storyline. It’s a survival horror adventure game that lets players control familiar characters Kazuma Kiryu and Shun Akiyama, as well as new playable characters Goro Majima and Ryuji Goda, as they navigate in an apocalyptic Kamurocho District filled with zombies.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>In the game, which is inspired by Sega’s The House of the Dead series, the zombie outbreak occurred a year after the events of Yakuza 4. The game is split into four parts, each focusing on the four characters’ efforts to help the residents of Kamurocho.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Panther 2: Like a Dragon Ashura Chapter (2012)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/black-panther-2-like-a-dragon-ashura-chapter.jpg><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>Another Japan-only release, Black Panther 2: Like a Dragon Ashura Chapter is the direct sequel to 2010’s Black Panther: Like a Dragon New Chapter.

In the game, Tatsuya has to join forces with other fighters in order to fight against another underground ring called Asura.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Like a Dragon: Ishin! (2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/like-a-dragon-ishin-2014.jpg><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Following in the footsteps of the first Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon Arrives!, this game is set in the Bakumatsu Period of Japan where warriors still held katanas. Players take on the role of samurai Ryoma Sakamoto as he fights enemies and mingles with people in this Yakuza game.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Ryoma embeds himself in society as he searches for the person responsible for the murder of his mentor. He joins the Shinsengumi after receiving information that the assailant could be a part of it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza 5 (2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-5-2015.jpg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>The sequel to Yakuza 4, Yakuza 5 maintained the series’ core mechanics but expanded its storyline to include more twists and an interesting plot. It also added new features and introduced new characters alongside familiar faces like Kazuma Kiryu and Shun Akiyama.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>The game takes players to five districts across Japan, including the now-familiar Kamurocho where events in earlier entries occurred. The game’s realism and diversions can entice fans to pick up a copy, or at least book a ticket to Japan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza 0 (2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-0-2017.jpg><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>A prequel to the entire Yakuza series, Yakuza 0 lets players alternate between series staple Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, the two main characters, at predetermined points in the story. The game is set about 17 years before the events of the first game, giving players an in-depth look at the main entries’ background.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Players have the freedom to customize the characters to their preferences using money they earn from fights or from Kiryu and Majima’s side businesses.

Created for the PS4, Yakuza Kiwami allowed players to relive the first game, but with better graphics, improved gameplay, and some additions to the storyline.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Despite being a remake of the first game, Yakuza Kiwami took some cues from Yakuza 0’s fighting system. It also introduced a new gameplay system that lets Majima challenge Kiryu anywhere in the game—while exploring, during minigames, and so on. This is a must-have for players who loved the first game as well as the prequel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life (2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-2018.jpg><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life removes other playable characters and lets players assume the role of Kazuma Kiryu as he searches for whoever is responsible for what happened to his adoptive daughter Haruka. Unlike in earlier entries, Kiryu uses one fighting style in this game, which means players might enjoy mastering all his moves or get bored repeating the same moves again and again.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>The game might feel watered-down to some, but it gives Kazuma’s saga a satisfying conclusion. This entry is a good starting point for those who are new to the entire Yakuza franchise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza Kiwami 2 (2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-kiwami-2-2018.jpg><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>The remake of Yakuza 2, Yakuza Kiwami 2 follows in the footsteps of the first remake but adds more improvements to overall gameplay and graphics.

It also features a new story scenario that lets players play as Majima.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Judgment (2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/judgment-2019.jpg><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Another spin-off in the Like a Dragon series of titles, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Judgment</a> highlights a private detective named Takayuki Yagami who spends his time investigating crimes in the Kamurocho district. This entry focuses more on stealth and investigation instead of the usual brawls found in other Yakuza games.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>This game was made out of a desire to create a story contrasting that of the original Yakuza series. And while some considered its detective mechanics simplistic, it became a popular choice among many players.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yakuza: Like a Dragon (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yakuza-like-a-dragon-2020.jpg><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>This game made a serious departure from the main titles and spin-offs to introduce a new character class system called Jobs, a new turn-based combat system, and a new protagonist named Ichiban Kasuga who, like Kiryu, was also imprisoned for something he didn’t do.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Yakuza: Like a Dragon was warmly received by many players and was praised for its narrative, gameplay, characters, presentation, and use of RPG mechanics. This will likely appeal to RPG fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Lost Judgment (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lost-judgment-2021.jpg><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>The sequel to the 2019 spin-off, Lost Judgment again lets players take on the role of detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate the events in the game’s world. The game brings back some mechanics from the earlier game, such as the combat system, but introduces new features as well.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Yagami, for example, has a new Snake fighting style in addition to the Crane and Tiger styles.
