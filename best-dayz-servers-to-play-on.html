Some are higher quality than others, while some integrate role-play mechanics into the game. This article will go over various DayZ server types so you can find the one for you.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=0-best-servers-for-dayz data-injectable=false>Best Servers for DayZ</h2><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After some evaluations of numerous servers, we have concluded that those listed below are the best ones available at the current moment. Included is a&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>server for everyone</span></strong>; whether <span data-preserver-spaces=true>you are looking for PVE, exploring, or trying to go more hardcore, we have you covered. Here are our <strong>top ten picks</strong> for <a href=#>DayZ </a>Servers.</span></p><ul data-found-items=10 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true><li>Table of Contents</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Underground data-injectable=false>DayZ Underground</h3><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>The first server on this list is<strong> fast-paced</strong>, aiming to test players’ DayZ skills. Focused on being an organic <strong>role-play</strong> server, your <strong>interactions are more natural</strong> and delivered well. This server is exceptional, with really <strong>cool laws</strong>, and it boasts one of the <strong>best communities</strong> of players who are incredibly creative but dangerous simultaneously.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>You’ll need to be on alert as there are possibilities of being captured or rescuing a friend from being tortured by using a <a href=#>Blood Transfusion</a>. You’ll never know what you will find, as it has <strong>many items and loot</strong> to discover. There is never a dull moment on this server, and it is hard to express how incredible the experience is in writing, so you must check it out yourself.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=XDC-DayZ data-injectable=false>XDC DayZ</h3><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>This server goes above and beyond to provide its user base with a solid experience. <strong>First-person only</strong> and <strong>zero tolerance towards cheating</strong> make this strict but still well worth it. From providing players with regular <strong>daily events</strong> to its complex <strong>base-building</strong> feature, you will pour hours into XDC.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>Players can find clothing, cars, helicopters, and tons of military gear throughout the map, adding to the reward system of exploring. It is important to note that all loot is up for grabs regardless of your level, so you must act fast to get the rare finds.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Namalsk data-injectable=false>Spaggies Namalsk Hardcore</h3><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Very few hardcore servers deliver an <strong>intense experience</strong> as great as Spaggies Namalsk. Starting with nothing but a watch and some flares, it feels like you are deserted on an island <a href=#>as your survival instincts instantly kick in</a>. The brutality of the map has users <strong>constantly battling with the cold weather</strong>, adding to the survival nature of the game. You can stumble across players willing to lend a helping hand or others with malicious intentions trying to kill you.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false><strong>Every decision</strong> on this server can make or break whether you survive through the night, from choosing whether to go into the city for supplies or build a fire so you can survive the deadly cold. Spaggies Namalsk takes some getting used to, but with practice, this makes for one of the best experiences on DayZ.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Absolute-Zero-Eden data-injectable=false>Absolute Zero Eden</h3><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Set on the map of Eden, this provides a<strong> tropical adventure</strong> with many points of interest worth checking out. This is the perfect server <strong>for those who want to explore</strong> the island and discover locations they haven’t seen before in the base game. <strong>Mods are included</strong> to improve clothing and building, and one that even adds a tiger to your gameplay.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>Mostly filled with PVP, you’ll want to watch your back as there isn’t much team-based combat, although sometimes you may get lucky and run into a friendly ally. That said, there aren’t many players online at one time, allowing you to let the explorer in you shine through for a more relaxing experience.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Archon-PVE data-injectable=false>Archon PVE</h3><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>This is the perfect server for players <a href=#>who want to play PVE instead of PVP</a>. Set on one of the most excellent maps of DayZ, it has everything you want from a server and more. Archon provides players with unique vehicles, safe zones, helicopters, trading, law, base building, <strong>weapons and clothing, and more</strong>.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>Integrated into the server is a<strong> zero-kill policy</strong>, meaning you won’t have to watch your back for other players trying to kill you and loot your belongings. More importantly, there’s a lot of <strong>team-based comba</strong>t against the zombies, making for one of the most outstanding server communities. It’s also a huge bonus that they have a responsive development team that continuously puts out updates to improve user experience.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=LowZone data-injectable=false>LowZone</h3><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>If you’re looking to spice up your DayZ experience with <a href=#>a bit of base-building</a>, Lowzone is the server for you. This server is based in Portugal and is populated primarily by Portuguese-speaking players, but those willing to work to overcome the language barrier are in for a fun time.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>This server comes ingrained with in-game currency and an in-depth bartering system you can use to trade for materials unique to the server. With these, you can build, expand, and furbish a base of operations. While the players can raid your home, it’s only allowed for a short timeframe during the day, so you’ll have plenty of time to set up defenses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=DayZ-Dystopia data-injectable=false>DayZ Dystopia</h3><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>DayZ is already a pretty scary game, but <strong>DayZ Dystopia</strong> cranks the horror to eleven. Everything about this server is designed to make <a href=#>the zombie survival experience</a> at the heart of DayZ even more terrifying. I’m both happy and afraid to report that it succeeds.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>The zombies of DayZ Dystopia are even more aggressive than they are in the main game, so even the most experienced DayZ players will have to step up their game to avoid becoming food for the dead. Combine this with a black market system and a faction-based roleplay mechanic, and you’ve got a DayZ server that will satisfy players looking to experience the zombie apocalypse as viscerally as possible.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Kryptic data-injectable=false>Kryptic</h3><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Let’s be honest; sometimes, you want to go mano y mano with another player with whom you’ve developed a serious (and hopefully healthy) rivalry. If you’re ready to face off with a dedicated friend/enemy, Kryptic is your best Dayz server.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>These servers spotlight the competitive aspects of DayZ’s gameplay formula, seeding the in-game world with powerful weapons while nearly eliminating crafting/survival elements for the equation. Even zombies are rare on these servers; it’s just you, your fellow players, and everything you could ever need to settle a good old-fashioned grudge.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Rearmed data-injectable=false>Rearmed</h3><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Rearmed is a prime example of a DayZ server that exists only to push the boundaries of what the main game can be. At its core, Rearmed is practically a vanilla server, but every baseline feature has been expanded to its reasonable extreme.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Rearmed introduced new weapons, vehicles, and gameplay mechanics like lockable doors and fully customizable missions, many of which are pulled directly from the popular team-based shooter Escape from Tarkov. These elements work seamlessly to deliver a high-voltage PVP experience that enhances to DayZ’s gameplay loop without sacrificing too much of its base charm.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Noobs-Only data-injectable=false>Noobs Only</h3><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>DayZ is a complicated game, one that asks a lot more of the player than most other multiplayer shooters. This means it can be difficult for new players to find their footing, but Noobs Only can make the process of beating the learning curve a lot easier.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>Insulting name aside, Boobs Only is an excellent server for players who are still learning how to play DayZ. The server replaces raids with missions designed to teach players tricks and tips that will make them better at the game, and the server’s admins work overtime to build an easy-going atmosphere that will make inexperienced DayZ players feel welcome and ready to learn.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=11-whats-the-best-dayz-server data-injectable=false>What’s the Best DayZ Server?</h2><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Each server has something unique, so you can’t go wrong with picking one over the other. Try them all out and see which one fits your playstyle the best! Hopefully, as these servers continue to improve, <a href=#>the number of DayZ players</a> will rise again to return to what it once was.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false><strong>DayZ</strong>&nbsp;is available now on PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS5, and PC.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
