He often wears a mask over his face to hide the scar he has on each side of his mouth. His hair is slightly pink in the manga but it is depicted as a soft blonde in the anime.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>While Sanzu’s hairstyle is not as extravagant as others, his natural hair color and its silky looks make it one of the most iconic in the series. It looks as if Sanzu is constantly taking care of his hair, given that it almost reaches his hips, a feat that is not easy to achieve.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>9. Ryusei Satou</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ryusei-as-seen-in-the-spin-off.jpg><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>A character exclusive to the spin-off series Letters from Keisuke Baji, Ryusei is the former Vice-Captain of Toman’s First Division.

Izana Kurokawa</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Izana-as-seen-in-the-anime.jpg><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>The main antagonist of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Third Season</a> of Tokyo Revengers, Izana is the captain of Tenjiku and the eight-generation Black Dragon Gangs.

Takashi Mitsuya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mitsuya-with-his-stylish-haircut.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Toman’s Second Division Captain is a young man who has always aspired to be a fashion designer in the future.

He is Kisaki’s right-hand man, following his friend wherever he goes.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>As a youngster, Hanma was more preoccupied with fighting than looking good, which is why his hair was in a simple spike shape, dyed blonde in the middle. In the timeline in which he and Kisaki took over Toman, Hanma revealed his true sense of fashion, now wearing his hair in an uneven sidecut with golden highlights that give him a more relaxed and mature look.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>4. Manjiro Sano</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mikey-during-one-of-the-possible-futures.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Toman’s leader and the strongest fighter in the series, Mikey is one of the main characters in Tokyo Revengers.
