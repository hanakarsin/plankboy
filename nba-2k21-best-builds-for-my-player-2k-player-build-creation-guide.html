This is your height, weight, wingspan, and body shape.&nbsp; Setting these to different levels will allow you to max out potential in different areas.&nbsp; Tinker around with these different types to get the exact archetype that you’re looking for.&nbsp; Changing these can drastically change your potential higher or lower depending on how far you skew away from the default height and weight for your position.</p><h3>Choosing your skill set and skill breakdown</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2k-potential.jpg alt=2k-potential width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The familiar pie chart from previous years is gone in NBA 2K22.&nbsp; Instead you will simply choose where you want to put your attribute points which will allow you to earn potential badges that will get you player up to a 99 Max Level.&nbsp; Depending on how you allocate the points and the attributes of your player you will be able to reach certain goals and milestones for you player.&nbsp; Earning the badges will allow you to have specific abilities.</p><h3>Maximize your Player’s Potential</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/max-potential-nba2k22.jpg alt=max-potential-nba2k22 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Putting it all together</h3><p>Depending on the type of player you want to build, changing your attributes will make things possible or impossible for your player to do.&nbsp; Changing things like Wingspan, Weight, and Height will allow you to speed boost (or not), get contact dunks (or not), and more.&nbsp; Depending on what you choose to put points into will give you the option to get more badges on a created player.&nbsp; Badges are certainly the differentiator between good 2k created players and average players.</p><h3>Choosing Your Takeover</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/choose-takeover-nba-2k22.jpg alt=choose-takeover-nba-2k22 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Your Takeover is the final piece of the puzzle and it will ultimately come down to personal preference when it’s time to pick your Takeover.&nbsp; Whichever suits your play style is the one that you’ll want to pick.&nbsp; However, when making a pure player like a Pure Sharpshooter or Glass Cleaning Forward, you should probably pick Lockdown Defender or Glass Cleaner as your Takeover just to get any associated boosts to your build.</p><h3>Best My Player Builds NBA 2K22</h3><p>My Player builds can be good or bad, but it really depends on who is controlling them.&nbsp; While the builds below have worked well in our hands, they might not mesh well with your playstyle or habits in the game.&nbsp; That’s why it’s important to note that you can feel free to experiment with these players adding or removing attributes when creating.&nbsp; Perhaps you like the core build, but want more finishing badges (for example’s sake) or want something slightly different.&nbsp; These builds are not set in stone, so experiment with them to see what feels good on the court to you.</p><h3>Two-Way Playmaker – Point Guard/ Shooting Guard</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/two-way-playmaker-2k22.jpg alt=two-way-playmaker-2k22 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Two Way Playmaker Guard/ Small Forward</h3><ul><li>Height – 6’5″</li><li>Weight – 195</li><li>Wingspan – 6’10”</li><li>Body Shape – Solid</li></ul><p>The Two-Way Playmaker is a good build that feels well rounded on the court.&nbsp; As the name denotes, “2 Way” means that this player is equally capable on the offense and defensive side of the ball with ample badges unlockable for Defensive/Rebounding/and Playmaking.&nbsp; This build will allow you to make plays, with enough shot points to allow you grab 10+ shooting badges which can keep you potent on the offensive side of the game.&nbsp; While the low part of your game will be in the finishing department, your driving layup and dunk should be enough to keep you relevant in the paint.</p><p>Once you get to the physical attributes end of this equation, you’ll likely want to experiment with your weight and wingspan.&nbsp; However, we suggest you keep your height at 6’5 low weight and high wingspan.</p><h3>Tall Playmaker – Small Forward</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tall-playmaker-nba-2k22.jpg alt=tall-playmaker-nba-2k22 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Tall Playmaker Small Forward</h3><ul><li>Height – 6’6″ – 6’8″</li><li>Weight – 195-200</li><li>Wingspan – 6’8″ – 6’10”</li><li>Body Shape – Defined</li></ul><p>This Playmaker Build is deadly because of the player’s size.&nbsp; You’re going to be making a 6’6 6’7 Small Forward.&nbsp; This player is going to be getting their own shots consistently with 30 Playmaker Badges and ample shooting badges as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;As always, these builds can be tweaked if you’d rather have a few less playmaking badges and more shooting or more defense.</p><h3>Lockdown Defender/Sharpshooter – SF</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lockdown-sharp-2k22.jpg alt=lockdown-sharp-2k22 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Lockdown Sharpshooter</h3><ul><li>Height – 6’6″</li><li>Weight – 220 lbs</li><li>Wingspan – 7′</li><li>Body Shape – Defined</li></ul><p>Want the best of both worlds?&nbsp; Good on Defense and Good at Shooting?&nbsp; The Lockdown Sharp is a competitive build that is equally proficient on both sides of the floor with plenty of Defensive Badges and plenty of Shooting as well.&nbsp; Think Michael Jordan in his latter years or Kawhi Leonard to some extent.</p><h3>Pure Sharpshooter</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pure-sharpshooter.jpg alt=pure-sharpshooter width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Pure Sharpshooter Shooting Guard/SF</h3><ul><li>Height – 6’5″</li><li>Weight – 205 lbs</li><li>Wingspan – 6’5″</li><li>Body Shape – Defined</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for pure shooting than you should definitely try to make the Pure Sharp build.&nbsp; As you would imagine this is a heavy green build that will afford you 30 Shooting Badges and all shooting stats at 90+ when you reach 99 overall.&nbsp; This will be a deadly shooter in almost any situation with some ball handling skills to get open on their own.&nbsp; The Sharpshooter build can be varied a bit to make Playmaking Sharps, Lockdown Sharps, and more.&nbsp; However, if you want the Pure Sharp put all the points into your shooting and then rain jumpers on your opponents.</p><h3>Glass Cleaning Power Forward/Center</h3><ul><li>Height – 6’10”</li><li>Weight – 240 lbs</li><li>Wingspan – 7’2″</li><li>Body Shape – Defined</li></ul><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/glass-cleaning-power-forward.jpg alt=glass-cleaning-power-forward width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The Power Forward and Center positions in 2k basketball is a dying art, but it’s still very necessary on a five man team.&nbsp; A dominant big man can crash the boards and this build will focus exclusively on cleaning the glass.&nbsp; To do this you will sink all your points into the Defensive and Rebounding Skills and end up at 95 Overall in Offensive and Defensive Rebounding.&nbsp; &nbsp;Physical attributes can be changed to increase some of these stats even further.&nbsp; While it’s nice to have a taller center or power forward, it’s probably beneficial to keep their height down around 6’9 or 6’10 so their speed doesn’t suffer.</p><h3>Paint Beast – Center/Power Forward</h3><img title="NBA 2K22 Best Builds for My Player - 2K Player Build Creation Guide" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/paint-beast-2k22.jpg alt=paint-beast-2k22 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><ul><li>Height – 7’1″</li><li>Weight – 290 lbs</li><li>Wingspan – 7’5″</li><li>Body Shape – Defined</li></ul><p>If you want an idea of what the Paint Beast is, it’s Shaq in the 90’s.&nbsp; Perhaps a little bit smaller than Shaq, but who isn’t.&nbsp; The Paint Beast is an in the paint finisher that has 90+ potential for all dunks, close shots, post hooks, as well as respectable overall post moves.&nbsp; 30 Finishing badges will allow you to finish in almost any situation.&nbsp; The Paint Beast will live and die in the paint, this will not be a player that has a versatile game in terms of shooting outside of the paint.&nbsp; This one dimensional player will simply try to overpower those in the lane.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZqeakWJ%2FrH6QZpmeq6Rir7a1y52qZp6fp3quxYypo5qxlad6c7eMqaOasZWneqPByKWbZpuimq61tc6nZKCtmZmycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnba-2k21-best-builds-for-my-player-2k-player-build-creation-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnba-2k21-best-builds-for-my-player-2k-player-build-creation-guide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnba-2k21-best-builds-for-my-player-2k-player-build-creation-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnba-2k21-best-builds-for-my-player-2k-player-build-creation-guide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnba-2k21-best-builds-for-my-player-2k-player-build-creation-guide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnba-2k21-best-builds-for-my-player-2k-player-build-creation-guide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/persona-5-guide-how-to-sprint.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/persona-5-guide-how-to-sprint.html>Persona 5 Guide: How To Sprint</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/lords-of-the-fallen-spells-guide-best-radiant-rhogar-and-umbral-spells.html>Lords of the Fallen Spells Guide: Best Radiant, Rhogar, and Umbral Spells</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/lords-of-the-fallen-spells-guide-best-radiant-rhogar-and-umbral-spells.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
