After defeating Abel, the leader of Magia Lupus, Mash is confronted by Cell War, who attempts to assassinate Abel. Mash inadvertently saves Abel, but Cell War makes another attempt on his life. Abyss intervenes and sustains a grave injury to his chest, which infuriates Mash. However, it becomes clear that defeating Cell War alone will not be an easy task as he is much more powerful. Here’s what happened in episode 12 and the Season 1 finale of Mashle: Magic and Muscles anime.</p><p data-characters=676 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>After Mash emerged victorious over Abel, he left the celebration abruptly while his friends stayed behind. Suddenly, a stern man named Cell War appeared and aggressively confronted Abel about his defeat. Cell War forced Abel to use his power to strangle himself. Meanwhile, Mash returned with a plate of cream puffs, unaware of the chaos. During the altercation, Mash accidentally sneezed, and cream puffs hit Cell War in the face, saving Abel from being strangled. Cell War continued his attack and attempted to use a sharp rock formation to kill Abel, but Abyss jumped before him and took the hit instead. Mash gave Abyss a magical handkerchief to treat his severe injuries.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Mash was in a fierce battle with Cell War, who launched a powerful spell, sending a barrage of rocks toward him. Despite Mash’s valiant efforts, Cell War seemed to gain the upper hand. In a critical moment, Abel intervened, shielding Mash from the attacks. Together, they were able to approach Cell War, and Mash delivered a powerful punch to his face.</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Where to Start Reading the Mashle Manga After Season 1 Ends</a></p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Cell War was impressed by Mash’s blow, but when he asked about Mash’s magical powers, Mash could not offer a clear answer, simply responding with “power.” This confused Cell War, who suspected that Mash was hiding his true abilities. Cell War presented a powerful artifact known as the Spellflection Mirror to test this theory, which reflected any spells cast towards it, amplifying their power. Dot was visibly scared upon seeing the mirror.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>It was then discovered that Cell Work had been using the Spellflection Mirror to gain an advantage in battle. Most magicians despised this dangerous item, but Mash, who had no magical abilities, could effortlessly break through the mirror, injuring himself. This revelation shocked those involved, but it was confirmed that Mash had not used magic to break through the mirror.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>Despite the difficult news, Abyss survived with the help of Mash’s magical handkerchief. Abel promised to take care of the situation and left with Abyss, expressing gratitude towards Burnedead for his help. Cell Work quickly excused himself, claiming that he had an important task to attend to, and assured Mash they would meet again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>When is the Mashle: Magic and Muscles Season 1 English Dub Release Date?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Mashle-English-Dub-Cast-1.jpg><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>The English dubbed version of Mashle: Magic and Muscles was released on May 26, 2023.
