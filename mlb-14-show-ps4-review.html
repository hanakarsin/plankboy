Quick Count is fun and quick, until it’s not. The random nature of what situation you’re placed into will sometimes feel stacked against you at the most inopportune times.</p><img title="MLB 14 The Show PS4 Review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/the-show-review-puig.jpg alt=the-show-review-puig width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>For those content with playing offline with friends, or taking on the game’s many offline modes like Season, Franchise, Road to the Show and Diamond Dynasty, there’s plenty of great baseball to be played here. Deep franchise and season modes allow for a ton of customization and multi-year team building toolsets. Franchise players are afforded a wealth of options in directing their teams to victory, which include scouting new talent and fostering player training to make them better over time. Road to the Show is a familiar mode, which has users creating a player to be drafted by an MLB team. Once done completing a set of games to showcase your talents, you’ll be drafted by an MLB organization, and then it’s time to work your way into the majors. Diamond Dynasty is a trading card game that’s been in The Show for a couple of years now, borrowing from EA’s popular Ultimate Team game mode, players build teams, earn tokens, and buy cards to fill out their rosters. There are online implications for Diamond Dynasty, but you can play against the CPU if you so choose. Playing games will net you points, which can be used to buy player card packs, access new stadiums, and improve your team. When you think it’s up to snuff, you can then head online to battle other players in more competitive games. When you’re not around, your team will earn these spendable points in an “Extra Innings” mode.</p><p>A lot of the modes in MLB The Show 14 blur the line between offline and online. Even when playing against a computer controlled opponent, stats and rosters are being pulled from MLB.com, allowing you to play the day’s MLB match-ups in modes like “The Show Live”. Or modes like Community Challenges aren’t necessarily playing against other opponents, but are dictated by players across the PlayStation Network.</p><img title="MLB 14 The Show PS4 Review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mlb-the-show-network-error.jpg alt=mlb-the-show-network-error width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Though when you do head online there are plenty of options as well. Ranked and Exhibition modes allow you to get a quick game of baseball in using a matchmaking system on PSN. Players can also search for and join, or create Online Franchises, which feature the same robust set of tools that their offline counterparts do. The only bad thing about some of the online modes is the myriad of problems that can occur when trying to play a online match. While it’s not as bad as previous years, there’s still some lag involved with online play. It can make hitting impossible if there’s too much lag, and can be very frustrating. There are also instances we’ve seen where the announcers flat out get calls wrong, or don’t make them at all. Instances of lag seem to be the most sporadic. There’s been no rhyme or reason to when they’ll occur. The developers have addressed fans when it comes to The Show Online, and claim that the game will get better with time. Head to head online match-ups weren’t the only area that we encountered network errors. Playing through the Diamond Dynasty online modes, and connecting to buy card packs from the marketplace, we encountered errors in this mode each and every time we played it. As it stands, it’s an enjoyable experience, and when it’s running smooth, it’s only slightly bested by the offline modes. Most of the issues we took with The Show ’14 came in the online aspects of the experience, but those who don’t like loading screens will probably be disappointed with the length of the ones found in this game.</p><p>Minor annoyances aside, when MLB ’14 The Show is running well, it’s an impressive game to say the least. The presentation will wow you each and every time you fire up the game, and there are modes for every type of player. MLB ’14 The Show is an integral upgrade for fans of the franchise that recently upgraded to the PS4. The enhanced visuals might not be the best or most realistic that we’ll ever see from the franchise, but they are the star of the show considering just how similar the feature set is between generations. With no competition in sight, PlayStation 4 players don’t have any other options when it comes to baseball simulations, but then again, the year-in and year-out commitment to quality from Sony San Diego made it so they never really needed those options in the first place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfp7K3tcSwqmilnJd6coCMrJ%2Bor12lwHV50Z6top2nZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmlb-14-show-ps4-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmlb-14-show-ps4-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmlb-14-show-ps4-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmlb-14-show-ps4-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmlb-14-show-ps4-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmlb-14-show-ps4-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/new-fortnite-venom-skin-leaked.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/new-fortnite-venom-skin-leaked.html>New Fortnite Venom Skin Leaked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/mashle-magic-and-muscle-manga-release-date-schedule-2023-when-you-can-expect-new-chapters.html>Mashle: Magic and Muscle Manga Release Date Schedule 2023: When You Can Expect New Chapters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/mashle-magic-and-muscle-manga-release-date-schedule-2023-when-you-can-expect-new-chapters.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
