Still, he is always ready to help Agent Twilight when it is needed and is one of the few people Loid can trust in his line of work.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Other Recurring Characters</h3><ul data-found-items=10 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=false><li>The Shopkeeper</li><li>W.I.S.E.
