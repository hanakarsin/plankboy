After defeating Anihal in combat the former holder of the Beastmaster Asterisk has agreed to spill the beans on the Water Crystal’s location.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Now all you need to do is leave the Underground Reservoir and return to Savalon. If you are reading ahead and need to go back to Part 2 of Chapter 1 you can do so by following the <a href=#>link here</a>.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Since Bravely Default 2 is a narrative-heavy game, I will try to keep all further spoilers to a minimum. Cutscene details will be scarce, and characters will only be named as required. Additionally, this walkthrough will follow a checklist format to keep things short and concise.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>I will list monsters encountered along the critical path (to include their weaknesses), and treasure chests (as well as what they contain). Enemies and bosses are natural but necessary spoilers, so I’ll go ahead and tag this article with a <strong>mild spoiler warning</strong> here, and I will precede every boss with a more obvious&nbsp;<strong>spoiler warning.</strong></p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bravely Default 2 Chapter 1 Part 3 Walkthrough</h2><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Head to Anihal’s home in Savalon</strong></h3><ul data-found-items=5 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false><li>Leave the Underground Reservoir either by foot or via a Teleport Stone.

You’ll be given a key to Bernard’s Mansion, but you won’t be able to raid the place until after visiting the palace (which you’ll automatically port to during the cutscene: convenient).<ul><li>Prince Castor will leave your party.</li></ul></li><li>Bernard’s Mansion is not actually in the town of Savalon, so you’ll need to venture outside into the World Map to reach it.<ul><li>Rest up at the inn, and stock up and upgrade your equipment at the vendor before setting out. You’re heading to another dungeon after all.</li></ul></li><li>After leaving Savalon you’ll need to head due east to reach Bernard’s Mansion. It’s along the coast, so use the larger minimap (by clicking R3) to orient yourself.<ul><li>The enemies out here should flee from you now, but you could always kill them for a little bit of experience and JP.</li><li>Once you find the opulent manor upon the hill simply approach it to enter.</li></ul></li></ul><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false><img title="Bravely Default 2 Walkthrough: Chapter 1 Part 3 - Bernard's Mansion and the Finale" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bravely-default-chapter-1-part-3-mansion.jpg alt=bravely-default-chapter-1-part-3-mansion width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Bernard’s Mansion</strong></h3><ul data-found-items=18 data-items-injection=true data-current-count=920 data-injectable=true><li data-index=0>A short cutscene will play when you step into Bernard’s Mansion.
