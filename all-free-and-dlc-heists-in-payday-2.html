But trying to dive in as a new player can be fairly daunting with the massive amount of DLC. Those starting their time in <a href=#>Payday 2</a> should learn about all free and DLC heists in the game — and which ones might be more important than the rest.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>All Free Heists Available in Payday 2</h2><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>There are a number of heists available to anyone who owns Payday 2, with many of them having been added through free updates. Keep in mind that <strong>the PC version has access to more heists than console versions</strong>, so you might be out of luck if you want to get the game’s full picture on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch.

These include:</p><ul data-found-items=4 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false><li>First World Bank — A redo of the Payday gang’s very first score.

Career mode also requires completion of certain DLC heists, but these can be completed for free by joining other players’ lobbies.</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Payday 2 Update 238 Patch Notes</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>All DLC Heists and Which Ones are the Most Important</h2><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>The DLC heists of Payday 2 all have some form of importance, whether through direct story relations or prerequisites for the true ending. Players should mostly be fine if they simply get <a href=#>the Legacy Collection bundle</a>, as practically every heist in that bundle relates to the true ending in some way. These are all the heists included in that bundle:</p><ul data-found-items=13 data-items-injection=true data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true><li data-index=0>Transport and Transport: Train Heist — A collection of heists that has players hitting armored cars and eventually a massive train holding a special weapon.

In the latter heist, players are tasked with skydiving out of a Murkywater plane along with massive pallets of cash.</li><li data-index=9>Counterfeit and Undercover — Classic, loud-only heists available as part of the Wolf Pack DLC. Players must get their hands on a money printer in the former and hack into the IRS with the help of a corrupt employee in the latter.</li><li data-index=10>The Biker Heist — A two-day, loud-only heist.

However, a few more DLC heists were added after these, taking place around or during the final few story heists such as Hell’s Island. Many of these heists also include non-liner objectives, letting players complete their missions in more varied ways. These are all of the “bonus” heists introduced as DLC in Payday 2:</p><ul data-found-items=12 data-items-injection=true data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true><li data-index=0>Border Crossing and Border Crystals — A pair of heists kicking off the “Silk Road” storyline.

If you don’t want to drown in the game’s massive selection of DLC while still getting a better idea of its story, consider getting your hands on heists involving <strong>the Dentist, the Butcher, and Locke</strong>. These are the best heists if you want to keep full track of the game’s story without worrying too much about crossover content.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
