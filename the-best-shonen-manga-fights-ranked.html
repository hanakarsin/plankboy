The best Shonen manga fights over the years are typically ranked by how they feel to read and how iconic they’ll become with the fandom.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Best 14 Fights in Shonen Manga, Ranked</h2><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>It’s nearly impossible to ignore the hype surrounding manga published by Shueisha, predominantly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Shonen Jump</a> thanks to iconic fights. There have been multiple standout manga even beyond just the Shonen Big Three that are poised to stand the test of time, with the following fights ranked from great to greatest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-All-Might-All-For-One-3.jpg><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>Keep in mind, this is evaluating the printed manga, and not anime. <strong>Below are each of the best fights ranked, but there are spoilers ahead, so you’ve been warned!</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>14. Naruto vs. Isshiki (Boruto: Naruto Next Generations)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Naruto-Isshiki.jpg><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>While people commonly cite Naruto and Sasuke vs. Momoshiki as their top Boruto fight, this one is my selection as an impressive showcase that leaped off the page. The stakes were incredibly real in this fight, and Naruto revealed a last-ditch power-up he could use thanks to Kurama: Baryon Mode. Suddenly, contact with the energy created by Naruto and Kurama’s conjoined chakra could drain Isshiki’s life force.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>This power-up came with a huge drawback, however. It was inevitably a move that would use up either or both of Kurama and Naruto’s chakra, so it was a sacrificial move. But it turned the tables and bought time while stealing it away from Isshiki, reducing his lifespan to mere minutes. While it’s among the best fights in the Boruto manga, it’s also quite exciting to see in the anime for Shonen fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>13. Star and Stripe vs. Shigaraki (My Hero Academia)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Star-and-Stripe-Shigaraki.jpg><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>America’s No. 1 pro hero goes in for the kill against a deadly villain. There are some truly killer sequences in this fight, where among other things, Star creates a vacuum to try and suffocate her opponent. Shigaraki, meanwhile, finds his consciousness fusing with All For One in these parts, raising the stakes for later in the series.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>The fight is visually very striking, with moments including an air construct pummelling Shigaraki. But the truth is, they would need to destroy every atom of him to defeat him in this fight, and with Star even being backed up by her fighter jet squadron, this would still prove a deadly challenge. It’s relatively quick to read, but it’s a total treat.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>12. Zoro vs. Kuma (One Piece)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Zoro-Kuma.jpg><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>I could have fun and leave the one-sentence response to this entry as the obligatory “Nothing happened” quote. But in all honesty, this confrontation between Zoro and Kuma revealed many fascinating details about each character. Kuma was identified as a Pacifista with an artificial body, and Zoro’s loyalty to Luffy was cemented as truly iconic in this moment from Chapter 485.</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=905 data-injectable=true>The idea was simple: either Luffy must die, or somebody must endure his suffering and take his place. Sanji attempted to offer, but Zoro knocked it away. Despite Zoro’s existing injuries, he would be expected to shoulder Luffy’s suffering as well, the result being presumably death. However, as you may well know, the result was a blood-soaked badass standing at death’s door but never opening it. When asked what happened, all he could muster was “Nothing…nothing at all!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>11. Rengoku vs. Akaza (Demon Slayer)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Rengoku-Akaza.jpg><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>This one is a bittersweet memory for a lot of folks. Rengoku, the Fire Hashira, was hailed by many fans for his iconic design and declared by many as the best character in Demon Slayer. His fight with Akaza was essentially his warrior Swan Song, the clash of the Flame Tiger against the Upper Ranks.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>In a series known for gorgeous visuals and epic clashes against evil forces, this fight simply had to make the list. It is the highlight of the Mugen Train Arc, with every action of his being to protect the innocent. This would push the remaining characters to become even stronger, but was a tragic day for fans everywhere.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>10. Rukia vs. Äs Nödt (Bleach)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Rukia-As-Nodt.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is as close to perfection as a Shonen manga adaptation can be. But one of the most cathartic moments for fans was seeing Rukia, who went a long time without significant development or interesting moments, had everybody glued to the screen. Its source material was perhaps more minimalist, but just as tantalizing.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>In one corner, you have Äs Nödt, Stern Ritter known as “The Fear”, and in another, you have Rukia, Captain of the 13th Division and master of Sode no Shirayuki. Her ice powers in their final battle came in clutch, providing a valuable barrier against Äs Nödt’s rapidly increasing fear-based attacks, halting them in the simplest way possible: freezing her body to a state of temporary death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bleach-Thousand-Year-Blood-War-Part-2-Episode-20-Release.jpg><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>The panel after she unleashed her bankai was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brought to magnificent life</a> in the recently released Part 2 of the TYBW anime. There’s only one word that can be spoken about this moment as it reveals her in her glacial form: “QUEEN.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>9. Yusuke vs. Younger Toguro (Yu Yu Hakusho)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Yusuke-Toguro.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Yu Yu Hakusho set up a pretty incredible legacy. It has been so influential that it is cited as an influence over Bungo Stray Dogs’ creation, is favorably compared to contemporary series like Bleach and Jujutsu Kaisen, and is even getting a live-action <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix adaptation</a>. The series handled power levels well, so when protagonist Yusuke Urameshi was pitted against Younger Toguro, the series showed us how far he’d come.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Yusuke was initially taught the Spirit Gun and was only able to fire it once a day. In this tournament, his training under his mentor Genkai had him start the fight by intentionally restraining his spirit energy. Meanwhile, Younger Toguro was holding back at first as well, seeking a worthy opponent. The result is one of the best, most compelling, and visually stunning of the classic Shonen manga fights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Yusuke-Toguro-2.jpg><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=833 data-injectable=true>But the deal he and his older brother made, giving them each otherworldly powers, would prove worth the investment when he’s pushed to assume his monstrous, insanely overmuscled form to give Yusuke the fight of his life in the Dark Tournament. A simple flick of the thumb by Toguro could create bursts of air strong enough to hit like bullets, and the ensuing fight was all the 90s manga readers could talk about. It doesn’t hurt that some of Toguro’s panels feature phenomenal artwork depicting his monstrous form.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>8. Shoto vs. Dabi (My Hero Academia)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Shoto-Dabi.jpg><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Dabi’s identity and connection to Shoto create a violent sibling rivalry and not the only one to make this list. But their confrontation in Chapter 352 of the manga is truly special, boasting some breathtaking panels and moving character development for Shoto.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Shoto was also seen as a bit of a loner for a lot of the series, but his acknowledgment of Class A always being there to cheer him on. His accomplishments in this fight would turn the tides in the surrounding greater battle, and earn him the praise and adoration of everyone around. It was a troubling fight between the Todoroki siblings, but a stunning one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>7. Gojo vs. Sukuna (Jujutsu Kaisen)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-233-Release-Date.jpg><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>The strongest sorcerer in history against the strongest sorcerer of today, Satoru Gojo vs. Ryomen Sukuna. This match in the Culling Game was immortalized in the Shinjuku Showdown Arc and still has fans in disbelief over its conclusion. However, it’s something that the series had been building to, and over 200 chapters later, it certainly was worth it as one of the best recent Shonen manga fights.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false><strong>However</strong>, since it’s a relatively new arc and has blown up all over social media, I recommend reading up first before seeing any of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">major spoilers</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>6. Sasuke vs. Itachi (Naruto)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Sasuke-Itachi.jpg><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>The fated battle between brothers was so keenly anticipated by fans since the earliest chapters in the manga that its panels remain iconic today. This was the legendary chip on Sasuke Uchiha’s shoulder for a long time in the series, and for this confrontation with Itachi, a deadly member of Akatsuki, you knew they’d pull out all the stops.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>This fight offered up a combat buffet of ninjutsu, taijutsu, and genjutsu thanks to a clash of Sharingan eye users. It was a visual smorgasbord featuring Amaterasu, Sword of Totsuka, Yata Mirror, and more techniques that would feature later on. But it was also tragic, with the two siblings knowing that one would have to die, and Sasuke would be devastated by the burden Itachi carried all of his life when he learns the truth behind the Uchiha Clan massacre.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>5. The Demon Slayers vs. Muzan (Demon Slayer)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Demon-Slayers-vs-Muzan.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Speaking of building up to an exciting battle, there are few examples more prominent than the showdown with the main villain of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Demon Slayer</a>. This was a confrontation that was split into two parts across the last two arcs of the series. It’s here that we see the Hashiras, Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and more duke it out with the big bad of the franchise.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Many fighters here die in pursuit of ending Muzan’s threat once and for all. Others are maimed or transformed. The sheer assortment of fighting styles and techniques put to use in this fight will likely wind up a glorious visual cacophony of colors and patterns when this is inevitably adapted for the anime.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>4. Ichigo vs. Byakuya (Bleach)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Ichigo-vs-Byakuya.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>There were a lot of iconic Bleach fights across the hundreds of chapters in its manga. TYBW may yet showcase some of its other strongest fights, but Ichigo vs. Byakuya still manages to stand out. This particular fight in the Soul Society Arc had fans wondering if Byakuya was taking it easy on Ichigo, but it’s impossible to ignore the utter style with which this fight was handled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Ichigo-vs-Byakuya-2.jpg><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>The truth is, the manga just felt so perfect when following this glorious fight. It’s loaded with 2-page spreads and panels that feel positively cinematic. Tite Kubo’s fantastic style helps this to be the truly standout battle it deserves to be. But in all reality, Bleach has such an incredible assortment of battles featuring its main and supporting characters that you should <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">give it a good read</a> before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TYBW Part 3</a> rolls around.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>3. Armored All Might vs. All For One (My Hero Academia)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-All-Might-All-For-One.jpg><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Several fights come to mind, but currently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the buzz around here</a> is all about Armored All Might’s Round 3 fight against the villain All For One. When I talk about bringing the heat in the form of jaw-dropping, electrifying panels, this is among the top examples.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>All Might knows which buttons to press in this fight. He lays the smackdown despite being Quirkless. Being 50 years old and being able to put up a deadly fight in a suped-up mechanical suit with combat gadgets might remind Western readers of something familiar. It’s oddly reminiscent of a The Dark Knight Returns Batman or even a Tony Stark figure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-All-Might-All-For-One-2.jpg><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>However, Toshinori Yagi is hardly a Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, or even a Stark. This entire fight is brimming with his personality, and it’s an immediate favorite among MHA readers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>2. Luffy vs. Kaido (One Piece)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Luffy-Kaido.jpg><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>I probably didn’t even need the parentheses in this case. It could also be relabeled as “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The One Where Luffy Goes Gear 5</a>“. Luffy’s final battle with Kaido was utterly nuts, and a deserved blockbuster moment for all One Piece fans who have been following its insane 1100+ chapter run and counting.</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=851 data-injectable=true>It’s at this phase like in many long-running Shonen manga or anime that its main characters attain a state of power far greater than anything they’ve ever achieved before. In DBZ, it was like when Gohan achieved SSJ2 in his showdown with Cell, or in Dragon Ball Super when Ultra Instinct was introduced and perfected. But in Luffy’s case, it transformed him into a god. A cartoonish god resembling the Monkey King from Journey to the West, but also one who could transform the environment around him and himself.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>The fight was insane. It was goofy and eye-popping for the readers as much as it was for the fictional fight’s spectators. But it was a glorious new height for Luffy and the Straw Hat crew, and seeing it brought to life in the anime, cartoon sound effects included, was a total crowd-pleaser.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>1. Naruto vs. Pain (Naruto)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Shonen-Manga-Fights-Ranked-Naruto-Pain.jpg><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>I’ll admit my slight bias here, but at the same time, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pain Arc truly was the definitive moment</a> for this iconic Big Three Shonen manga. It was built-up not as an insistent reminder like Sasuke’s vendetta against Itachi, but as a byproduct of a cruel world outside of Konoha that produced one of the most fascinating, misguided antagonists in Naruto history. The world of Naruto created Pain, and Pain would change it forever.</p><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Pain killed Naruto’s mentor Jiraiya, prompting the young ninja to train in the Pervy Sage’s techniques and truly surpass him. It was prompt in the series where Naruto reached unfathomably difficult new heights of his power while still struggling to control the tailed beast sealed within him. But Naruto’s not alone, as Pain’s assault is a battle where seemingly all of Konoha band together to defend their home. It is loaded with awesome panels, dramatic twists, and some pretty emotional moments all while still reminding the readers that his fight with Pain wasn’t over yet.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Despite his home being turned into a crater, and allies and loved ones seemingly perishing at Pain’s hand, Naruto still claws his way back to the surface. Empowered by the love that kept him and his home alive and the Sage Mode, this truly was the peak of Naruto and of its sequel series Boruto that still has yet to be matched.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
