Iida then thanks his friend for allowing him to become his ideal self.</li><li data-index=4>And that’s why he wishes for Shouto to become his ideal self. This is when a narration shows what he wrote in the letters to his mother: he says that he is giving his best every day to reach his classmates’ level. He’s even been practicing conversation.</li><li data-index=5>These conversations have led to many conflicts, but the resolution of said conflicts has allowed him to understand other people’s feelings.

However, the temperature is not decreasing, indicating that an explosion is inevitable. Despite this, Rei, Fuyumi, and Natuso continue to use their Frost Quirks to cool Dabi down. Dabi finds pleasure in the attention he is receiving and reflects on Endeavor’s presence, wondering why this had not happened sooner.</p><p data-characters=726 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>As the firebomb intensifies, the battle between the Heroes and the Twice Doubles heats up. Tiger urges everyone to retreat to avoid being caught in the blast zone while Uravity remains behind to confront Himiko. The Heroes and evacuated civilians evacuated the area on robots and vehicles, attempting to escape the explosion.
