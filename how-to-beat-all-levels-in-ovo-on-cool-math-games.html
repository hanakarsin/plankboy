This article will take you through how to beat all levels in <a href=#>Ovo</a>.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Complete Every OvO Level on Cool Math Games</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 1 (Basics Chapter)</h3><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>Level one is nice and simple,<strong> all you have to do is move to the right (with the arrow keys) and then perform one jump</strong> with the spacebar over the gap. You can collect the coin in the gap first if you so choose.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 2</h3><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>For this level <strong>move to the right and perform two jumps</strong>. You will eventually reach a wall in front of you. <strong>Go directly next to this wall until you’re touching it then jump</strong>. You will get a much higher jump and be able to hop over on top.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false><strong>Make your way to the hatched lines from here and jump then press the down arrow key</strong> to smash through. Move to just under the next platform above and <strong>do one more smash then jump immediately after to reach the next platform</strong>. Reach the flag afterward.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 3</h3><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true><strong>Slide down the wall in front of you</strong> then go up to the wall to the right of you. Jump into this wall then <strong>move over to the left wall, and keep wall-jumping up until you reach the platform</strong>. From here you can get to the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 4</h3><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false><strong>Slide under the first wall</strong> (run and press the down arrow key) then stop. <strong>Perform another slide but jump while sliding before you fall off the edge</strong>. From here you <strong>then can jump over to the flag</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 5</h3><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>J<strong>ump over the first set of spikes then slide and jump up onto the small platform</strong>. From here you can <strong>jump and dive over to the flag</strong>. Press the down arrow key while you are in the air to dive over.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 6</h3><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true><strong>Make one jump and dive over to the platform then immediately jump</strong> when you land. This will let you move over to the next area. From here you can move onto the spring in front of you and get up to the top platform. Proceed to the right and drop down. From there you can slide onto the next spring after a slide under the wall.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Now use the next spring and <strong>continue on the path — jumping when you have to — until you reach a wall jump area</strong>. Make a few wall jumps and then you can reach the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 7</h3><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false><strong>Wall jump in this level for the first part until you land on the hatched lines. Jump and do a smash down to then get through the platform</strong>. Perform another few wall jumps and you can reach the flag after.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 8</h3><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>For OvO level 8 you will have to <strong>jump over the first set of spikes and then jump off the next platform. Dive then jump again when you hit the ground</strong>. This will catapult you from a spring up towards the flag.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>How to Make Money Fast in Wartales: Best Money Making Strategies</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 9 (Getting Serious Chapter)</h3><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>On your journey to beat all levels in OvO, level 9 is where things start ramping up in difficulty. You will see the flag directly to your left. If you try and walk into it a wall will come down in front of it.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true><strong>Make your way to the right and jump then dive over the spikes.</strong> <strong>Jump over the gap in the ground and go up to the side of the wall</strong>. Jump when touching the wall and move right up onto the next platform. <strong>Hop up to the ledge then wall jump up to the top</strong>.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Slide under the spikes then <strong>jump, dive, jump again, and smash downwards with the down arrow key when you’re in between the wall and the spikes</strong>. You will then reach the flag. Timing is key here.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 10</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OVO-level-10.jpg><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>For level 10 you will want to <strong>slide into the first “Strong” spring</strong>, from here you will get sent up to the “Weak” spring which will then bring you to the next platform. Jump down the gap at the left side wall and hit into the spring on the side. It will bounce you to the next section.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>From here you can jump over the spike and walk into the next spring. Jump over the next spike and then reach the springs. Bounce up them until you reach the top and <strong>you can also wall jump to get an extra boost</strong>. Now walk into the next spring and jump up to hit the diagonal spring.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>Afterward, go through the spring corridor and <strong>dive (down arrow key) when your character is moving upwards to get over the spikes</strong>. From here walk into the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 11</h3><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>For level 11 jump over the first spikes then run to the right. When you drop down to the next section, turn left and slide under the wall but jump before you hit the spikes. <strong>When you are above the gab on your jump, smash downwards</strong>.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>Slide under the next wall and into the spring. You can either smash downwards after you have passed the spikes or you can hold your left arrow key and tap it until you land safely. From here proceed to jump up the springs to the flag. Wall jump if you need it at the top.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 12</h3><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>The first section of this level is all about timing your wall jumps. You need to <strong>get over the spikes by wall-jumping to various platforms above them</strong>. If you continue to wall jump whenever you can, you will reach the other side in no time.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>In the next part, you can wall jump up again but this time tap or hold your left arrow key when reaching the top platform to ensure you don’t land on the spikes. Jump over the spikes and then perform another jump to the left but also dive in the air to reach the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 13</h3><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>For level 13 you have to walk under the first sets of spikes and walls. <strong>Take things slowly and then proceed to the next area</strong>. Make your way up the side walls until your reach the top section. Jump over the spikes that are rising up and make your way to the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 14</h3><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>When you start level 14 <strong>jump up to either the left or the right where it says “Here” on the screen</strong>. You can then wall jump up to the top again and make your way through the corridor. There are gaps in the tops that you can use to jump up and avoid the moving wall of spikes. There are also two gaps you can drop into.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>Continue through the corridor until you can wall jump over the spikes and dive to reach the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 15</h3><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>In level 15 <strong>stick as close to the center as you can</strong> in order to avoid the moving walls and spikes. You will eventually be able to wall jump up the middle to get to the flag at the top.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 16</h3><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>There is a sneaky shortcut for level 16 that you can use. This can be <strong>done by jumping down the right side off of the platform</strong> and moving around to reach the bottom flag without hitting anything. However, if you prefer to complete the level the normal way you just have to move around and avoid the spikes which will go through the platform.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 17 (Higher Order Chapter)</h3><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>In level 17 you can <strong>push yourself into the walls while sliding down to slow down on them</strong>. <strong>Perform small jumps off them to the other side’s wall to avoid the spikes</strong>. Do this throughout the level and you will be reaching the flag in no time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 18</h3><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>At this level, you can <strong>use the first spring to jump yourself up to the platform underneath the hatched lines</strong>. Jump through them and then make your way up the wall. Get over to the other side and then smash down through the next set of hatched lines.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>You will be back in the main area now and you can jump through the final set of hatched lines to reach the flag.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Best Super Mario Galaxy Characters</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 19</h3><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>In level 19 you will have to <strong>combine a variety of slides, jumps, and wall jumps</strong> to make your way through. Avoid the spikes and make dives when you need to. By always being on the move with your jumps you will be at the flag at the top in no time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 20</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OvO-Level-20.jpg><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>When starting this level you will want to <strong>move to the left and slide and jump over the first set of spikes</strong>. <strong>Hug the wall (stand close to it) on the left and then jump to get over the next set</strong> of spikes and hit the spring.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Make your way through the level naturally wall jumping and avoiding the spikes until you get to a central area with a spring facing diagonally. Jump into this and then go up through the hatched lines. Slide, jump, and then dive to reach the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 21</h3><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>For level 21<strong> use the springs and jump up them avoiding the spikes as you go</strong>. If you are successful at this you will be able to get to the flag at the top platform. As a piece of advice, it can be beneficial to tap the arrow keys instead of holding them if you need more fine-tuning on movement with landing.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 22</h3><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>After you have gotten used to fine-tuning movement you will be able to put it to the test at this level. When jumping on the springs, <strong>tune your movement and land in the small gaps</strong>. You will eventually keep making your way through the level until you can get to the flag.</p><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Dives can also be useful to speed things up even more.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 23</h3><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>For level 23 make your way through the level by using all of your core movement mechanics. Wall jumping and dives are going to be useful here. Keep going through the level until you reach the section where <strong>there is a note saying “Believe and Dive”. Get to the edge of the platform and jump and dive off.</strong> You will then reach the flag which waits below you.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 24</h3><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>For level 24 you will have to make your way around a maze of spikes. <strong>The best way to get through this level is by combining slides and jumps when you need to</strong>. There will also be times you have to wall jump up the sides of walls to get past various spikes on your way. With some practice, you will be able to get to the flag in the center.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 25 (Mechanics Chapter)</h3><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>Level 25 acts as a tutorial level for the Mechanics chapter. <strong>Make your way down and up the left side to then hit the switch at the top by walking into it</strong>. Smash through the hatch lines and walk into the flag on the right.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 26</h3><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>On level 26 there will be three “doors” you have to open. If you get eliminated after activating one switch you won’t lose any door progress. <strong>Jump down through the gap at the bottom of the floor and you can activate the first switch in the room below</strong>. From there make your way back up and go into the second-door room.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true><strong>Make your way up to the top left platform and jump across to activate the next switch</strong>. From there you can then go into <strong>the next door from the central area and activate the next switch to open the flag door</strong>. Wall jump up and you can then reach the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 27</h3><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>For OvO level 27 you <strong>have to dive and jump above the first set of spikes but keep beneath the spikes moving downwards</strong>. Continue through the main pathway of the level until you reach an area with a diagonal spring. When you are jumping down to this section, don’t move when you fall through the right-side gap to land on the platform.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Go into the spring and then jump through the hatched lines and slide and jump then dive to reach the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 28</h3><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Level 28 will have you avoiding a sliding wall of spikes. <strong>Hit the switches as you are going and jump and dive through the wall of spikes</strong>. Make your way to the far right and go down to the next section.<br>Jump over and slide under the ceiling of spikes.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>From here you can smash through the hatched lines to activate the next switch. <strong>Go to where it says “wrong way” and then jump up to go into the wall</strong>. Move through and get up to the top until you can jump over the spikes and get to the flag.</p><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=31 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>7 Best Mario Wii Games</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 29</h3><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>For level 29 <strong>hit the switch then go on the moving platform</strong>. Walk forwards and move over to the next platform. Slide and jump to get above this and continue along the path, jumping to avoid the spikes as you go. <strong>Smash through the hatched lines and activate switches along the way</strong>. Jump on the spring and then either take the platform to the flag or jump and dive to get to the platform and then the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 30</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OVO-level-30.jpg><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>In level 30 <strong>slide under the first set of spikes and smash down through the hatched lines</strong>. When the platform is moving to the left, jump, smash, then jump again to get to the spring. From here you can ride the platform until above the next hatched lines. Wait on the hatched lines until the lower platform is underneath. Smash through to reach that platform.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Proceed to time this in a similar way for the next sections and <strong>then go through the hatched lines that do not have a symbol above them. Activate the switch and then ride the next moving platform. Jump over the spikes and don’t hit the switch here</strong>. Finally, reach the flag after that section.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 31</h3><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>In level 31 you will have a moving floor map which is caused by activating the switches. <strong>Make your way to the left of the map activating switches as you go. Work your way around the map until you get to the flag up at the top reached by wall jumping after opening the top red wall with a switch</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 32</h3><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>For level 32 you will have to be quick. <strong>Slide under the first two sets of walls and activate the switches. Activate the next switch and jump, smash, then jump and dive through the top opening gap</strong>. Go into the spring in the next area and keep sliding until you reach a gap in the floor. Drop through here and then activate the switch.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true><strong>Make your way back up and around to get to the flag at the far right of the level</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 33 (OvO Space Program Chapter)</h3><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Within level 33 you have to <strong>go through the red platform when it opens up. Drop through and then jump over the spikes to the right side. When you hit the switch and the rocket fires, run back and keep jumping over the spikes as you go. Jump and smash down through the red-hatched lines</strong>.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Now you can then run to the right and slide through the next hatched lines to drop down and keep sliding to the right. You will avoid the rockets while doing this and then slide into the springs to get to the flag area. Jump and smash through the hatched lines to reach it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 34</h3><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>In level 34 you will need to go to the right and hit the switch up at the top. <strong>Use the walls for cover from the rockets if you need to</strong>. Go to the left and then work your way up to the next switch by standing next to the left-side wall and jumping. <strong>This will get you more height and allow you to start getting up to the area with the switch</strong>.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>Go back to the main room and go through the gap in the floor. Run and jump to avoid the spikes and keep activating switches as you’re running. <strong>Proceed through the area and then you will get to the flag. You will need to slide and jump over the final set of rockets and then smash through the hatched lines</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 35</h3><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>For level 35 you will notice that the red platform at the bottom will start to rise up. <strong>All you have to do is avoid the rockets until the platform lifts up and you can slide under to reach the flag beneath there</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 36</h3><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>In level 36 you have to slide under the first set of spikes and then jump before you reach the next. Do another slide after this and hit the switch. <strong>You can then make your way back with a similar process. Activate the next switch at the left and then wait until the walls open. Go down and make your way through the corridor until your reach the springs</strong>.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Get up the springs and when hitting the top one: hold the left arrow key to avoid the ceiling spikes. You don’t have to activate the next switch so go to the next spring and get around up on the top. <strong>You can then make your way down until you can slide, jump, dive, and then smash downwards to reach the flag</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 37</h3><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>For level 37 there is <strong>a shortcut that you can get to by jumping down to the bottom floor which is hidden on the screen</strong>. Make your way to the right and jump over the spikes to reach the flag.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 38</h3><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>Level 38 is quite sneaky. <strong>When the red platform opens up, wall jump back to where you came from. You can find the flag by exiting at the top left, falling down, and moving to the left while in the air</strong>.</p><p data-characters=57 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>10 Rare Super Mario Collectibles You Need to Own</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 39</h3><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>In level 39 you have to <strong>slide, jump, and dive over the set of spikes and then fall down to the flag. That is how to complete this level</strong>. You will get a nice view of what looks like starry skies in the background.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>OvO Level 40</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OvO-Level-40-1.jpg><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Level 40 is nice and simple, you can <strong>move to the left and slide and jump-dive over the spikes.
