Millions of kids were playing this new game called Pokemon, and suddenly rumors started flying through playgrounds and school hallways that there were actually 151 Pokemon in the game, not the 150 that we’d all been told we had to catch. But, how could that be? And how could you actually get him in your game?</p><p>The answers came in various forms, some cheated their way through, using Gamesharks or something like that. Finally a few glitches showed up that could reliably deliver a Mew. The Gameshark is no long an option, so here’s our guide on how to get Mew in Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console.</p><p>So far, it’s been confirmed that these glitches still work, as the games are pretty much straight ports of the old ones. Still, if you have trouble implementing them let us know in the comments. The big bonus though is that these VC releases will be able to transfer Pokemon up to the newer games, so you will have a Level 7 Mew in Pokemon Sun and Moon at launch if you pull this off.</p><h3>How to Get Mew in Pokemon Yellow, Pokemon Red, and Pokemon Blue</h3><p>For Pokemon Red and Blue there is a glitch that actually allows you to get Mew before even taking on the second gym. Before you start, make sure you have plenty of Pokeballs, as you’ll need them to get Mew. Follow these steps to give it a shot.</p><p>Get to Cerulean City, where the second gym is located, clear the Nugget Bridge that takes you to Route 24, battling your rival&nbsp;on the way. Stop fighting at this point, this is very important to the rest of the steps for&nbsp;how to get Mew in Pokemon Yellow, Red, and Blue.</p><p>At the top of the bridge, on the left side past some water and standing two rows of grass down in a field you’ll see a single trainer. Don’t fight him, you need him for other purposes. Walk around him, keeping out of his sightline, and keep doing this until you catch an Abra (this is probably the hardest part and will take a while.</p><img title="How to Get Mew in Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pokemon-Yellow-Pokemon-Red-Pokemon-Blue-How-to-Get-Mew.jpg alt=Pokemon-Yellow-Pokemon-Red-Pokemon-Blue-How-to-Get-Mew width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Once you’ve got him, head left&nbsp;to Route 25. Finish off every single trainer here except for a single, specific one. You’ll see him standing north of two rocks with a female trainer two spaces to the south, with a pillar of five rocks standing to his left (as he is facing north). If you have trouble spotting him, just save your game and battle everyone. Once you find the trainer with a level 17 Slowpoke you have found your guy. Load the game up from the previous save and fight everyone but him. Save your game at this point to prevent any issues.</p><p>Use Abra’s teleport ability to head to the Pokecenter to heal up. Now go back to where you caught Abra and stand at the top left corner of the water, next to the bridge.Save your game again. Once you’re ready to try the glitch, press down and start at the same time. The key is to get the trainer’s attention, while pausing the game at the same time.</p><p>If this seemed to work, use Abra’s teleport ability once again, then head back to Route 25 and fight the Youngster that you left there. You need to make sure he walks into you and not the other way around or Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue might crash. Once he’s defeated you need to teleport away again.</p><p>Once you make it back to Cerulean City head back to the bridge. If all was done correctly, once you walk across the border from the city to Route 24 your menu will open on its own. Press B or Start to close and BAM! Mew will be fighting you. He’s only a level 7, so pretty easy to catch. Just be careful not to knock him out.</p><p>Once you have him you are good to go. You can just wait for Pokemon Sun and Moon to hit and then transfer him to the new games via Pokemon Bank.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVforyjtcueZqCdpGK6psOMqaaknZ2ku26%2BxJ1km6Slmnq6sculprBn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fget-mew-pokemon-red-blue-yellow.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fget-mew-pokemon-red-blue-yellow.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fget-mew-pokemon-red-blue-yellow.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fget-mew-pokemon-red-blue-yellow.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fget-mew-pokemon-red-blue-yellow.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fget-mew-pokemon-red-blue-yellow.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/how-to-get-nekros-in-warframe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/how-to-get-nekros-in-warframe.html>How to Get Nekros in Warframe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/how-to-get-leather-steel-ingots-and-components-in-assassins-creed-mirage.html>How to Get Leather, Steel Ingots, and Components in Assassin's Creed Mirage</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/how-to-get-leather-steel-ingots-and-components-in-assassins-creed-mirage.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
