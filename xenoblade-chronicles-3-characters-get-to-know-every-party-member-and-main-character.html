His duty as an off-seer is the mourn the dead after the battle, however, he quickly finds this to be a vicious cycle.&nbsp; A pacifist by nature, he often conceals just how strong he truly is.&nbsp; He is dogmatic to a fault at times, mourning even the deaths of his enemies, and often serves as the group’s visionary.&nbsp; In-game he is 9 terms old.&nbsp; The initial class is Swordfighter, although his sword is, in typical Xenoblade fashion, not all that it seems.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Lanz</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Characters: Get to Know Every Party Member and Main Character" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Lanz.jpeg alt=Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Lanz width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>The stalwart defender of Noah’s group, Lanz has at numerous points put his life on the line to keep his comrades from dying in battle.&nbsp; Even during exercises as a younger soldier he demonstrated his willingness to defend at all costs and carries with him the loss of a dear comrade.&nbsp; Lanz, a man of action, is sometimes frustrated with Noah’s more peaceable, meditative methods, but remains a loyal companion.&nbsp; In-game he is 9 terms old.&nbsp; The initial class is Heavy Guard.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Eunie</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Characters: Get to Know Every Party Member and Main Character" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Eunie.jpg alt=Eunie width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>A longtime friend of both Noah and Lanz, Eunie can be fully open with her views and opinions, sometimes coming off as brash.&nbsp; She is shown to have some of the earliest glimpses into the truth behind the events taking place in the game, and bonds well with her allies from Agnus.&nbsp; She is the group’s healer and bears that responsibility as much as possible, wanting to keep her friends, and herself, alive.&nbsp; In-game she is 9 terms old.&nbsp; The initial class is Medic Gunner.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Mio</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Characters: Get to Know Every Party Member and Main Character" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Mio-and-Noah.jpg alt=Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Mio-and-Noah width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Leader of the Agnus group met by Noah early on, Mio wears her heart on her sleeve even more so than Noah and is her group’s off-seer.&nbsp; She and Noah find common ground on many topics but immediately connect over their musical training and mutual goals.&nbsp; Additionally, her age, 10 terms, makes for her to be extremely close to her Homecoming event, which is the end of the lifespan for the soldiers of Aionios.&nbsp; Her initial class is Zephyr.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Sena</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Characters: Get to Know Every Party Member and Main Character" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Sena.jpg alt=Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Sena width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>Mio’s closest friend, Sena is an extremely strong individual despite her small frame, showing early on her potential to be the strongest of both groups, while maintaining an energetic, cheerful persona.&nbsp; While she has some difficulty connecting with others, and even Mio from time to time, she bonds quickly with others over shared interests, finding Lanz to be a perfect training partner.&nbsp; In-game she is 9 terms old.&nbsp; The initial class is Ogre.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Taion</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Characters: Get to Know Every Party Member and Main Character" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Taion.jpg alt=Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Taion width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>The group’s tactician, Taion can be seen potentially as arrogant, but he is oftentimes the most considerate of the bunch, showing remarkable tact and knowing just when to push somebody’s buttons when he knows it’ll be for the best.&nbsp; Taion wrestles with a previous loss during his service, one that he will have to come to terms with, and until then, he bears one of the greatest emotional barriers of the group.&nbsp; In-game he is 9 terms old.&nbsp; The initial class is Tactician.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Beyond the main characters and Heroes, you’ll also meet a villainous syndicate of Consuls behind the scenes, and behind them?&nbsp;
