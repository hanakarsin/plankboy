<time>02 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=258 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Ego Jinpachi’s unorthodox experiment, known as the <a href=#>Blue Lock</a> project, has pushed Japan’s best strikers to their limits. Many have lost not only their chance to win Blue Lock but also their dreams of playing professional soccer as the show has progressed.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>The few who have survived are without a doubt the most powerful and skilled players, each with their strengths and weaknesses. However, some strikers have a clear advantage and stand above the rest. Below, we will take a look at the 10 best players the Blue Lock project has to offer.</p><p data-characters=44 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false><strong>Beware of major plot spoilers for Blue Lock.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>A Ranking of Blue Lock‘s Best Strikers</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>10. Rensuke Kunigami</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kunigami-against-Team-V.jpg><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>A former member of Team Z, Rensuke has been proving how much talent he possesses since the beginning. An outstanding striker who climbed from the very bottom of the project to the top 10 quickly. With the help of Isagi, Rensuke was able to reach his full potential, being one of the first members of Team Z to score a goal.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>He is also among the physically strongest players in the show, and his accuracy with the ball is almost professional-like. If the conditions are met, Kunigami’s powerful legs can shoot powerful strikes, which are almost certain to end in goal. Sadly, his abilities rely on having an efficient team that can help him play to the best of his abilities.</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All Blue Lock Chains, Explained – What is the Meaning of Each Character’s Chain</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>9. Reo Mikage</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Reo-Mikage-from-Blue-Lock.jpg><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Most of the players who took part in the Blue Lock project earned their spot for excelling in either skills, intelligence, or by having natural talent. Reo Mikage, on the other hand, found his way into the competition by being an all-rounder, meaning he can play any role but is not a master of any of them.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Despite not being the best on any given field, Reo has not fallen behind his fellow competitors. His unique set of abilities gives him the opportunity any weapon his opponents use, to a lesser degree. Woefully, he cannot copy natural-given skills, such as powerful kicks or incredible speed.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>8. Aoshi Tokimitsu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Aoshi-tackling-Isagi.jpg><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>For a striker, speed and agility are among their best weapons, with physical might only being used on certain occasions. However, having more brawn than the rest is not always a bad thing, as proven by the meek Aoshi. He is arguably the strongest and biggest player in all of Blue Lock, with enough power to slam any opponent to the ground with a single push.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>If you see Aoshi coming at you, it is best to move out of his way, as he could cause some serious damage. In spite of his physique, Tokimitsu does not seem to affect him when running or maneuvering the ball. Still, he is behind many others in terms of speed and agility, which could be a hindrance in the future.</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=41 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Blue Lock Anime Watch Order</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>7. Hyoma Chigiri</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chigiri-outrunning-his-opponents.jpg><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Another former member of Team Z, Hyoma had to go on a travel of self-discovery to regain his love for soccer. While at first Chigiri refused to play at his full potential, Isagi helped him overcome his past trauma and demonstrate his true strengths.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>He is one of the fastest and most durable players in the project, capable of running long distances within seconds, all without getting tired. This helps him take the ball back from the opposing team before they can even react, and travel between the two sides of the field to score goals without interference. Yet, speed is not everything for a striker, which is why he cannot be considered the strongest. &nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>6. Jyubei Aryu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Aryu-playing-with-Chigiris-hair.jpg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Whoever said sports and fashionable looks do not match never met Jyubei, a striker who cares about his looks as much as soccer. Nevertheless, he is still equally as talented and hard-working as every other member of the Blue Lock project. Amidst the other participants, Aryu stands out for his impressive height and long limbs.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Thanks to his above-average stature Jyubei has a much easier time intercepting passes, running long distances, and stealing the ball than his opponents. He uses this to his advantage at every chance, being a truly valuable asset to any team he is a member of. Still, his height cannot help him against players with stronger builds or better strategies.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>5. Shouei Barou</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Barou-kicking-the-ball.jpg><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>The self-proclaimed King of Soccer, better known as Shouei Barou, is arguably the most imposing and intimidating participant of Blue Lock. He is bigger and more muscular than most of his peers and possesses a gigantic ego that he is not afraid of showing off. Fortunately for him, he has the skills necessary to back up how big he talks about himself.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>Due to his menacing aura and strong body, Barou can overpower his opponents, which he uses to easily make his way to the opposing team’s goal. While he is not as accurate when shooting from a distance, he is one of the most reliable goalers when up close. Yet, his skills are on a slightly lower level than the real powerhouses of the show.</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Lock Chapter 230 Spoilers, Release Timeline, and Recap</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>4. Meguru Bachira</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bachira-after-awakening.jpg><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Outside the field, Bachira is a kind, friendly, and cheerful young man who loves making friends and helping others. When he is playing, his friendly demeanor goes out the window, being replaced with his monstrous egoism. Meguru is capable of anything to keep his dream of becoming the best striker in the world alive.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Bachira is the most notable dribbler in the show, which helps him retain the ball for prolonged periods without anyone being able to take it from him. He is also incredibly agile and flexible, skills that can help him move in ways most players could not. If not for his lack of physical strength and shooting power, Bachira could have become the best player in Blue Lock.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>3. Seishirou Nagi</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Nagi-tricking-Barou.jpg><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Almost every striker recruited into the Blue Lock project wanted nothing more than to crush the competition and become the victor. Up until his game against Team Z, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seishirou Nagi</a> was the only participant who lacked the motivation to push himself further, as he had never once lost a game in his life. Isagi made sure to beat him and awaken the beast inside Nagi, who completely changed.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>As of now, Nagi is one of the most talented and driven players, wishing to surpass Isagi and crown himself the winner of Blue Lock. His weapon is the ability to control the ball no matter where he touches it, having absolute control even in the air. Still, his initial lack of inspiration put him behind two other magnificent strikers.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>2. Isagi Yoichi</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Isagi-scoring-a-goal.jpg><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>The protagonist of Blue Lock, Isagi, may seem like a kind and selfless boy who always plays by the rules. After meeting Bachira, Yoichi awakened his slumbering egotistical instincts, turning into a selfish individual who cares only about winning. While he still cares about the people on his team, he would not have an issue with betraying them if it meant winning the project.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Opposed to the majority of Blue Lock’s participants, Isagi’s weapon is not linked with his physical abilities. He has an above-average spatial awareness and an outstanding strategic mind, both of which help him come up with plans in a matter of seconds.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Does Isagi Get Bachira Back in Blue Lock?</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>1. Rin Itoshi</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rin-surrounded-by-a-dark-mist.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Being the brother of Japan’s most famous soccer star was not easy for Rin, who lived under the shadow of his older brother Sae. He joined Blue Lock because he wished to surpass his brother and prove he was never inferior to him. He has been trained his whole life to achieve this goal, resulting in him being almost as talented as his brother.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=false>His kicks, passes, and goal shoots are almost mechanical, with almost perfect accuracy. Rin also possesses overall soccer skills that rival even pro players, a feat that no other Blue Lock player can claim to have achieved. Rin’s play style appears to be flawless, with none of the other strikers coming near his level.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
