<time>24 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=362 data-injectable=true data-video=true>For fans of <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong>, there is nothing better than pulling a <strong>rare pet</strong>. However, there are some pets that even the luckiest of players will not be able to find, especially the ones on this list. Whether given away as an <strong>Admin Bonus</strong> or only available throughout <strong>toy sales</strong> that are no longer on the market, these pets will be impossible to find for players.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>However, getting a chance to see which pets are <strong>super rare</strong> is exciting, especially for gamers that are just getting into the game. It sometimes feels that there are <strong>urban legends</strong> regarding some of these pets, so getting a chance to see them is rather exciting. Without further ado, let’s find out the <strong>rarest pets</strong> in <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong>, and what players had to do to get their hands on them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Rarest Pets In Pet Simulator X on Roblox</h2><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>We’ve all heard about some of these rare animals, but getting the chance to view them is pretty exciting. Let’s dive right in and find out some more information on these pets, and how players were lucky enough to snag them for their own.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Rainbow Huge Pegasus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rainbow-Huge-Pegasus-PSX.jpg><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>With only <strong>one of these</strong> in existence, this is easily one of, if not the <strong>rarest pet</strong> in <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong>. Available only as an <a href=#><strong>NFT</strong>,</a> players will need to save up a pretty penny if they’re hoping to add this to their ever-growing roster of pets within the game.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>While all of them were available as <strong>NFT</strong> purchases, the <strong>Huge Rainbow Pegasus</strong> is the rarest of the group. The owner of this particular pet is trying to currently sell it for <strong>over a million dollars</strong>, making this quite the investment for gamers hoping to have one of their own.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hubert Cat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hubert-PSX.jpg><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false><strong>Hubert</strong> may look like a normal cat within the world of <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong>, but for players hoping to get their hands on an original, authentic one, it may be almost impossible. As one of the <strong>rarest pets</strong> in the game, this little kitty was available at one time for being an <strong>Admin</strong> for the game. There are currently <strong>less than 5 authentic Huberts</strong> available within this world.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>While gamers can hatch plenty of other feline friends, <strong>Hubert</strong> is easily one of the rarest to find. They would need to befriend one of the <strong>Admins</strong> that have this particular pet, and hope that they would be willing to trade for something, which is highly unlikely since this pet is so sought after.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Storm Wolf (Non-Duped)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Storm-Wolf-PSX.jpg><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>While plenty of gamers may have a <strong>Storm Wolf</strong> of their own, is it an <strong>authentic </strong>version of the pet? When this creature was originally released, players would have had to purchase it for <strong><a href=#>5,550 Robux</a></strong>, which is not a cheap asking price for a pet. However, after obtaining one, players discovered that there was a <strong>glitch</strong> that would allow them to <strong>duplicate and distribute</strong> plenty of this particular creature.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>There are a fair number of <strong>Storm Wolf</strong> out in the wild today, but the rarest version of this particular pet has to be the <strong>non-duped version</strong>, and they can be quite valuable if players are lucky enough to find one. Those hoping to add this creature to their collection are going to need to shell out a fair bit of cash to finally get it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>2 Damage Hippomelon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hippomelon-PSX.jpg><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>While the <strong>Hippomelon</strong> itself is quite rare, only available during the <strong>April Fools 2022 Event</strong>, the glitched <strong>2 Damage Variant</strong> is going to be the talk of the town. The standard <strong>Hippomelon</strong> is quite the powerful pet, with damage numbers normally in the <strong>millions</strong>, but this glitched variant can only do 2 damage to anything in its vicinity.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>While it may be fairly useless for anything besides showing off, that hasn’t stopped players from searching far and wide to find this particular variant. Anyone that has a <strong>2 Damage Hippomelon</strong> has something quite valuable, and those hoping to get their hands on it are willing to pay the price to claim one for their own.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Rainbow Huge Pumpkin Cat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rainbow-Huge-Pumpkin-Cat.jpg><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>While the standard <strong>Pumpkin Cat</strong> is not super rare, the <strong>Huge Variants</strong> are a bit harder to come by. However, gamers that tried their best to get the Rainbow Huge Pumpkin Cat, they know precisely why this particular creature is one of the rarest in the game. Featuring the <strong>lowest overall hatch rate</strong> out of any animal in the game, at a <strong>0.00002% hatch rate</strong>, anyone that was lucky enough to get one of these <strong>Cursed Egg Exclusive</strong> animals has something quite exciting.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>This does only apply to the <strong>Rainbow Huge</strong> variant of this particular animal, however. While a fair number of gamers were lucky enough to get their hands on the <strong>Huge Variant Pumpkin Cat</strong> during the <strong>Halloween 2021 Event</strong>, there are very, very few that were able to get the <strong>Rainbow Huge Pumpkin Cat</strong>, making this the rarest hatchable animal currently available.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Huge Cat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Huge-Cat-PSX.jpg><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Anyone lucky enough to own the <strong>Huge Cat</strong> animal in <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong> has something quite valuable, indeed. Available only as a special download with the purchase of the <a href=#><strong>Huge Cat Plushie</strong></a> on <strong>Biggames.io</strong>, this is one of the few exclusive animals that required the purchase of a real-world object.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>The <strong>Huge Cat Plushie</strong> was a limited stock item that received no form of <strong>restocking</strong>, so it was available on a <strong>first-come</strong>, <strong>first-serve</strong> basis for major fans of this experience. It was also a fairly pricey plush, available at <strong>$59.99</strong>, making this an expensive purchase for everyone. However, this did grant players the ability to own one of the rarest and most valuable animals in the game, so the trade-off was worth it in the end.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Huge Golden Forest Wyvern</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Huge-Golden-Forest-Wyvern-PSX.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Gamers that were around during the <strong>Glitch Update</strong> in <strong>January 2022</strong> know the horror stories involving the <strong>Golden Huge Forest Wyvern</strong>, and why it is now one of the rarest pets to find in the game. Players needed to purchase <strong>Exclusive Eggs</strong> for a chance to hatch one of these creatures, and at <strong>800 Robux per Egg</strong>, players needed the RNG Gods on their side for this one.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>With only a <strong>2% Hatch Chance</strong>, there is a good chance that players may have never gotten the opportunity to get this particular pet, especially with its inclusion on this list. Selling for around <strong>4 Billion Diamonds</strong> now, players that were able to get this pet have quite the investment opportunity on their hands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Rainbow Huge Samurai Bull</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Huge-Samuari-Bull.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Easily the most valuable pet available within the world of <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong>, with an estimated value of <strong>150 Trillion Diamonds</strong>. No, that’s not a typo, it’s just an absolutely incredible amount of diamonds that players would need to obtain to get a chance to own this pet.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Available only as an <strong>Exclusive DLC Pet</strong>, players would have had to get lucky with a <strong>Season One Toy</strong> to get their hands on this particular pet, and with those toys no longer being on the market, the chances to finally get one for your own without needing to drain your bank account are more or less gone at this point. However, players lucky enough to own this pet have something quite special on their hands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Huge Golden Easter Cat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Golden-Huge-Easter-Cat.jpg><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>With less than <strong>40 Huge Golden Easter Cats</strong> available within the game, this is another one of those hyper-rare pets that most players will never get the chance to own. Players would have needed some major luck to hatch one of these pets using the <strong>Legendary Easter Egg </strong>during the <strong>2022 Easter Event</strong>, and it seems that only a few players had that much luck.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>However, those that own one of these particular pets, they’ve got something worth a pretty penny, or plenty of diamonds. Since the <strong>Cats</strong> seem to be one of the most sought-after variants within the game, players will be willing to drop whatever they need to for a chance to have the <strong>Huge Golden Easter Cat</strong> in <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Blue BIG Maskot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Big-Blue-Maskot.jpg><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>It almost feels like cheating to put this particular pet on the list, but this is easily one of the rarest and most expensive pets for a plethora of reasons. Fans that were hoping to claim the <strong>Big Blue Maskot</strong> for their own needed to play <strong>dress up </strong>with their <strong>Roblox Avatar</strong> and unlock the <strong>Dress Up! Achievement</strong>. Doesn’t sound too bad, right? Well, that’s where things get a bit more difficult.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Fans would need to <strong>purchase particular items</strong>, including the rare and expensive <strong><a href=#>Orange Ninja Headband of All Earth’s Fire</a></strong>, which seems to retail at around <b>USD 150</b> at this point. Originally, it was only <strong>500 Robux</strong> but now normally retails around <strong>44,000 Robux</strong> on average. However, those that did jump into this were rewarded with one of the rarest pets around.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>With all of these super rare pets, will gamers start on their journey to claim a few of their own? There is plenty to do within the world of <strong>Pet Simulator X</strong>, so start earning <strong>Diamonds</strong> and trying to trade a few pets to get a few grails along the way!</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false><strong>Roblox</strong> is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Mobile Devices, and PC.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
