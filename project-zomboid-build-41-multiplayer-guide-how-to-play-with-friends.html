What you’re looking for is the option to join them in their session.&nbsp; Click that and you’ll be on your way.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can search for their server in the ‘Join’ menu, selecting ‘Internet’ at the top and not ‘Favorites’ and entering their server name in the bottom left ‘Name Filter’ box, highlighting their server, and clicking join, after which you’ll simply need to <a href=#>build your character to your specifications</a> and set out in the game world.&nbsp; Be sure to add the server as a favorite if you want to use it in the future, too!</p><img title="Project Zomboid Build 41 Multiplayer Guide: How to Play With Friends" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Project-Zomboid-Join-Menu-1280x720.jpg alt=Project-Zomboid-Join-Menu-1280x720 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>How to Host</h3><p>Creating a server in Project Zomboid is easy enough.&nbsp; From the main menu, you simply click ‘Host’ and decide on the particulars of their server name and memory settings, but don’t worry too much about these details for now.&nbsp; To the right, there is an option called ‘Manage Settings’ and thereafter you will see options to create new settings, or edit settings if they want to edit these.&nbsp; After you provide a name for the settings you will be treated to a large array of options to optimize the Project Zomboid multiplayer experience for you and your friends.&nbsp; This includes how your server appears in the in-game search function as well as Steam, which you can customize by its name as well as whether it’s public and therefore will show up for others to find, friend or stranger alike.</p><p>You can also customize certain functions like Presets to change the in-game world to anything from an apocalypse to a more peaceful building and survival sim.&nbsp; You can even customize loot rarity, which can help make the survival experience easier or more challenging depending on how easy it is to find bandages, food, and ammunition.&nbsp; The server can be changed made to have as many as 126 players on it, too.&nbsp; Once you’ve picked your settings, save them and click back to the ‘Host Game’ menu once again and click ‘Start’ at the lower left&nbsp; You can choose whether you as the host are in God mode or invisible, as well.</p><img title="Project Zomboid Build 41 Multiplayer Guide: How to Play With Friends" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Project-Zomboid-Editing-Settings-1280x720.jpg alt=Project-Zomboid-Editing-Settings-1280x720 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Adding players is much easier after all that through Steam, as you can simply open the pause menu, click ‘Invite Friends’, and either click on the box that says ‘Deny’ which toggles to ‘Allow’ which enables them to join you, or even better, select the friend you wish to invite by name as they appear, and click ‘Invite’ at the bottom.&nbsp; They’ll receive a simple invitation via Steam they can click to enter.&nbsp; Project Zomboid even recommends invited players not to have the game running before receiving the invitation, and after accepting there will be a message that prompts to say the game is being open with special parameters, they just need to click ‘OK’ and they’ll be in your game.</p><h3>It’s a Dangerous World Out There</h3><p>Once everybody is on, you’ll quickly realize you haven’t spawned in the same location every time.&nbsp; That’s okay!&nbsp; Even if so, part of the charm of this game is fending for yourself while navigating the in-game map and figuring out a safe place to meet and form your band of survivors.&nbsp; Once you do, you’ll find there is plenty you will need to <a href=#>learn to adapt</a> and <a href=#>get across the infected landscapes</a> of Kentucky.</p><p>Project Zomboid Build 41 released December 20, 2021 and the multiplayer has been a hit with players and streamers alike.&nbsp; The game’s developers, The Indie Stone, have reminded players that despite this improvement they are always working to improve the experience going forward.&nbsp; The multiplayer experience can be a tad frustrating to set up, and navigating the menus when wanting to host your own server can be confusing, but we are happy to help provide any insight we can along the way.</p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZqmqn5%2BypMCMs6ammp%2BesW6u1KKjnWVkZnquwcutoKmkka6ys3nGrqCdnV2dvLh506hkqaSRrnq4tdOhZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fproject-zomboid-build-41-multiplayer-guide-how-to-play-with-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fproject-zomboid-build-41-multiplayer-guide-how-to-play-with-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fproject-zomboid-build-41-multiplayer-guide-how-to-play-with-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fproject-zomboid-build-41-multiplayer-guide-how-to-play-with-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fproject-zomboid-build-41-multiplayer-guide-how-to-play-with-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fproject-zomboid-build-41-multiplayer-guide-how-to-play-with-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/raiden-shogun-material-locations-where-to-find-baals-ascension-materials-in-genshin-impact.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/raiden-shogun-material-locations-where-to-find-baals-ascension-materials-in-genshin-impact.html>Raiden Shogun Material Locations: Where to Find Baals Ascension Materials in Genshin Impact</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/pokemon-go-guide-how-to-earn-coins-in-new-gyms.html>Pokemon Go Guide: How to Earn Coins and Stardust in New Gyms</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/pokemon-go-guide-how-to-earn-coins-in-new-gyms.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
