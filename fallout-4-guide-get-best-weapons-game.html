However, that last bit can be pretty tough, as the world is gigantic and full of items to sift through. If you want to get the best weapons in the Fallout 4 wasteland then you’ll have to know where to look, so here’s a quick guide. This Fallout 4 Weapons Guide will show you how to get the best melee weapons, missile launchers, automatic rifles, assault rifles, energy guns and other legendary weapons that you’ll encounter in the world of Fallout 4 giving you your best odds for survival.</p><h2>The Best Weapons in Fallout 4</h2><ul><li><strong>Cryolator</strong> – High Damage with the ability to freeze enemies</li><li><strong>Righteous Authority</strong> – Energy Weapon that makes critical shots do more damage</li><li><strong>Junk Jet</strong> – Can be loaded with junk inventory for ammunition</li><li><strong>Furious Power Fist</strong> – High Damage Melee Weapon</li><li><strong>Big Boy</strong> – Most powerful weapon in the game fires two mini-nukes</li><li><strong>Deliverer</strong> – Silenced gun that uses 10mm ammunition</li><li><strong>Alien Blaster</strong> – Energy weapon that does high damage</li><li><strong>Spray N’ Pray</strong> – Fires explosive rounds that do high damage</li><li><strong>Harpoon Gun</strong> – Fires deadly harpoon rounds</li><li><strong>Fat Man</strong> – Fires a single Mini-Nuke</li></ul><h2>The Best Fallout 4 Weapons and How to Find Them</h2><h3>Cryolator</h3><p><strong>Where to find The Cryolator</strong></p><p>This weapon is great for a couple of reasons. First off, it’s right there in Vault 111 from the beginning of the game. Second, it does decent damage and can become pretty formidable when modded properly. Finally, it usually freezes its target, sometimes causing a one-shot kill. It’s downside is that it has very little ammo available, but you can check out <a href=#>our other guide</a> to find more.</p><p>To find the weapon itself you just need to head to Vault 111. In the Overseer’s room you probably saw the Cryolator locked behind a Master lock. If you have leveled up enough you can just pick this lock and get to it. If not you should grab Dogmeat and bring him hear. Telling him to find an item will usually get you the Cryolator, but be sure to get the ammo off Dogmeat as well.</p><h3>Righteous Authority</h3><p><strong>Where to find Righteous Authority</strong></p><p>Probably one of the best early energy weapons in Fallout 4, Righteous Authority is easy to get and should cover your needs well into the main story. To get this gun just complete the Call to Arms quest given to you by Paladin Danse at Cambridge Police Station. The gun has some nice modifiers on it, making your critical shots do more damage, and allowing the meter to fill faster.</p><h3>Junk Jet</h3><p><strong>Where to find The Junk Jet</strong></p><p>The Junk Jet is a pretty unique weapon in Fallout 4, as it doesn’t require any real ammo. Instead, as the name implies, the gun uses junk. Any item that goes into the junk category of your inventory can be loaded and fired from this thing, causing some serious damage. Whether it’s a teddy bear, desk fan, or a bowling ball, the Junk Jet will fire it and can easily take down a few feral ghouls. You’ll just have to be careful if you’re doing a lot of workshop building, as there’s actually a lot of <a href=#>stuff to do with all of that junk</a> in Fallout 4.</p><h3>Furious Power Fist</h3><p><strong>Where to find Furious Power Fist&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This epic melee contraption will be pretty tough to get ahold of. It is found in Swan Pond inside of the Boston Common. Unfortunately it’s being guarded by a gigantic monster. Taking him out will be very difficult, so bring explosives and whatever else might be helpful. I’d suggest waiting until you have some spare mini-nukes and are a pretty high level character before even attempting this though. Once he’s down just loot the body to find the Furious Power Fist.</p><h3>Big Boy</h3><p><strong>Where to find Big Boy in Fallout 4</strong></p><p>The slightly more insane alternative to the Fat Man. The Big Boy is probably the most powerful weapon in all of Fallout 4. It can be found only at a merchant, the Commonwealth Weaponry shop in Diamond City to be specific. This modified Fat Man will actually fire off two mini-nukes at once and will give radiation damage. Of course, this thing doesn’t come cheap, costing over 13,000 caps. Get your Charisma and Barter up high enough and you can drop this a bit, but never to a reasonable point.</p><h3>Deliverer</h3><p><strong>Where to find the Deliverer&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This gun has quickly become my day-to-day weapon in Fallout 4. The main advantage the Deliverer has over others is that it uses simple 10mm ammo, which can be found in nearly every ammo crate, chest, or box in the wasteland. The gun comes standard with VATS and action point boosters, and the already modded silencer makes it great for those sneak attacks. To get it you need to <a href=#>follow the Freedom Trail</a> and join the Railroad. Keep doing the quests here until you complete Tradecraft and you’ll be handed the Deliverer.</p><h3>Alien Blaster</h3><p><strong>Where to find Alien Blaster</strong></p><p>Easily one of the best guns in the game, as long as you have a high enough Science perk to modify it to use Fusion Cells. The Alien Blaster is pretty unique in how you find it. We put together a full guide on triggering the event and finding the weapon once it happens, so <a href=#>check it out here</a> for all the details.</p><h3>Spary N’ Pray</h3><p><strong>Where to find Spray N’ Pray</strong></p><p>This is the machine gun you’ll want to carry in Fallout 4. Spray N’ Pray can be found only from a traveling merchant named Cricket, so if you see her be sure to check out her stock. The gun does a decent amount of damage on its own, but the big bonus is that the bullets explode on impact, dealing extra damage, along with an area-of-effect boost.</p><h3>Harpoon Gun</h3><p><strong>Where to find the Harpoon Gun&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As the name says this gun fires harpoons at your enemies.&nbsp; The Harpoon Gun is found in The Oceanarium and will likely have ammunition there as well.&nbsp; The only downside to this powerful weapon is that the harpoons that you use for ammunition are hard to come by.&nbsp; You can stumble across this ammunition in the Far Harbor DLC, but if you want to stock up you can head to the shops in Far Harbor to purchase harpoons directly.&nbsp; If you’re having trouble finding the Harpoon Gun, check out this <a href=#>guide to Far Harbor.</a></p><h3>Fat Man</h3><p><strong>Where to Find the Fat Man</strong></p><p>The Fat Man is the Big Boy’s little brother when it comes to weapons in Fallout 4.&nbsp; This powerful launcher weapon can be loaded with mini-nukes, one of the most powerful explosives in the game.&nbsp; The Fat Man can be found in numerous locations in Fallout 4, but you’ll definitely find one in Outpost Zimonja.&nbsp; This is smack dab in the middle of The Wasteland.&nbsp; You’ll need to beat a tough foe to get it so prepare before heading out to find this powerful weapon.&nbsp; <a href=#>You can find the Fat Man right here.</a></p><p>Looking for Power Armor to go along with your weapons?&nbsp; <a href=#>Find the most powerful armor in Fallout 4 here.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZp%2BZnKG8tsCMbWSgrZmZsm6zxK1km52jqXq4scCppqerXZyurrGO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffallout-4-guide-get-best-weapons-game.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffallout-4-guide-get-best-weapons-game.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffallout-4-guide-get-best-weapons-game.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffallout-4-guide-get-best-weapons-game.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffallout-4-guide-get-best-weapons-game.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffallout-4-guide-get-best-weapons-game.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/ffxiv-how-to-make-more-gil-as-an-alchemist.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/ffxiv-how-to-make-more-gil-as-an-alchemist.html>FFXIV: How to Make More Gil As an Alchemist</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/does-hogwarts-legacy-have-vr-support-answered.html>Does Hogwarts Legacy Have VR Support?
