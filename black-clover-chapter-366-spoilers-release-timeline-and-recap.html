As Asta said his goodbyes and thanked the Hino Country people for all their help, Finral arrived to pick up Asta.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>While Asta seemed happy to see Finral, Shogun Ryuya Ryudo had something much more important to ask him. Ryuya knew that one more person could join Asta and go to the Clover Kingdom, hence he suggested Finral take Ichika with them. Ichika rejected this idea at first as she believed that her place was with Ryuya.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>That’s when Yosuga Mushogatake assured Ichika that he will make sure to protect the Shogun and the Hino Country. Ryuya added to this and told Ichika to go to the Clover Kingdom and reunite with her older brother Yami Sukehiro.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>“Ichika, go and see Yami…!! And then, definitely come back alive…!!”<br>Ichika finally agreed to the idea and joined Asta in going to the Clover Kingdom with Finral. Thus, all three of them entered the Door of Fate and reached the Clover Kingdom.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Black Clover chapter 366 then showed Asta having arrived at the Clover Kingdom. He was left angry upon seeing his Magic Knight squad mates being beaten and left in such a sorry state. That’s when Damnatio tried to intimidate him. However, Asta felt confident in himself as he asked Finral to focus on medical treatment, while he would take on the Paladin by himself.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>Asta whipped out his Demon Slasher Katana and walked toward Damnatio to fight him. He was certain that he was going to win and was left unfazed by Damnatio’s threats. Damnatio used his Air Magic to pass judgment on Asta, however, Asta canceled it out using his Anti-Magic. Damnatio was left surprised by this as Finral could understand that Asta had become more adept at using Anti-Magic.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Asta remarked Damnatio’s magic to be very incompatible with his Anti-Magic. Following that, he questioned Damnatio’s morals as he was contradicting his statements about justice and peace. Right after, Black Clover chapter 366 spoilers showed Asta slashing Damnatio using his Zetten.</p><p data-characters=16 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Break next week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Clover Chapter 365 Recap</h2><p data-characters=695 data-current-count=1005 data-injectable=true>Black Clover Chapter 365, “500 Years of Solitude.” The Black Bulls continue to fight against Paladin Damnatio, while Secre stays away to protect herself and prevent her healing from undoing. In a flashback, she thinks about how she lived for 500 years to complete her mission and how she was willing to die once it was complete. However, she met Prince Lumiere, who thanked her for her service and asked her to find happiness with her new friends, so she joined the Black Bulls. Now, witnessing her friends’ defeat causes her immense pain, and she calls for Asta’s help. Asta returns just in time to save the day with a memorable head pat that shows his character growth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Clover Chapter 366 Predictions</h2><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>I’m excited about the next chapter because I think Asta will humiliate Damnatio, proving he’s the next wizard king. If Asta struggles, it’ll look not suitable for his matchup against Lucius, who’s more potent than a paladin he made. I hope Asta beats him so severely that even the Queen of Witches is shaken. This theory comes from Asta’s protectiveness of his friends.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>However, fans are divided over Asta’s return due to its pros and cons. Although it emphasizes the importance of the protagonist’s power to overcome the enemy, it also sidelines the concept of teamwork when characters like the Black Bulls, who are already powerful, are reduced to simply buying time. But, the Witch Queen and Dorothy could still help Asta in his fight against Domnatio because they weren’t removed from the fight even though they were defeated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><span>Black Clover Chapter 366 Release Timeline</span></h2><p>Black Clover Chapter 366</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=164 data-injectable=false>The Black Clover Chapter 366 release timeline is&nbsp;<strong>1:00 AM JST</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>Monday, July</strong> <strong>24</strong>, 2023.
