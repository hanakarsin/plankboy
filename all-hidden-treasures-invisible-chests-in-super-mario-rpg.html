This time around, though, players are tracked on how many blocks they find, technically requiring them to search for every one if they want to do every bit of side content possible. Finding the locations of all Hidden Treasures is a daunting task in <a href=#>Super Mario RPG</a>, even with the remake’s earlier access to the Signal Ring.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Get All Hidden Treasures in Super Mario RPG</h2><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>This task is significantly easier in the remake than it is in the original. This is thanks to very early access to the Signal Ring, an item that alerts players when they’re in a room with a Hidden Treasure.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Its original location — the top-right house in Nimbus Land — now grants access to the Echo Signal Ring, a similar item that makes beeping noises as players get closer to the chest.

At the very start of the area, you’ll find its first treasure in the western corner of a small open patch of dirt, just across from a collectible mushroom. This treasure contains a Croaka Cola.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-forest-maze-hidden-treasures-3.jpg><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>The next Hidden Treasure can be found just after the first cave in the maze.

The rightmost stump will have its treasure located a few steps down from the exact middle of the cave. If you manage to find this one, you’ll get an instant-use Flower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-forest-maze-bad-luck.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>In the middle-left stump, you’ll find a Hidden Treasure that acts more as a joke than a real reward. It can be found in the northmost corner of the cave, but hitting it will only lead to a statement of “Bad luck!” without any item. This is the only Hidden Treasure to not have a reward in any form, so it’s only worth collecting for comedy or completion’s sake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-forest-maze-hidden-treasures-5.jpg><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>The next Hidden Treasure is found just behind the sleeping Wiggler in the top-left stump.

Before heading past the Save Block, head to the south corner of the area and jump around to eventually reveal the treasure. Inside is a Red Essence, one of the rarest and most powerful items in the game.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Notably, this is the only Hidden Treasure to be relocated in the remake. It was originally found just before the maze-like portion where you follow Geno, in the right corner of the room next to the maze’s entrance.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>The contents of the chest haven’t changed, and no other Hidden Treasures were altered outside of the increased ease of access for the one in Peach’s Castle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-pipe-vault-hidden-treasures.jpg><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>Two Hidden Treasures can be found in the Pipe Vault, found in a room accessed from the line of pipes filled with Piranha Plants.

The Hidden Treasure is located just by the northern corner of this room. Despite its close proximity to the Snifits, no battles are required to hit it. You’ll get one Frog Coin out of this treasure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-booster-tower-hidden-treasures-3.jpg><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>The next Hidden Treasure is found just after being launched higher up the tower by a Thwomp.

It can be helpful when preparing for the upcoming boss battle — or battles, depending on your reflexes — but if you’ve already cleared the tower, the only point of getting it is for the sake of completion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-marrymore-hidden-treasure.jpg><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>The final Hidden Treasure of the region is located in Marrymore’s hotel.

While travelling through the ship, you’ll end up in a small room where a mirrored Mario will halt your progress. By jumping around the middle of the room, you’ll find a hidden J block that reveals the Hidden Treasure. Shuffle against the false Mario and use his head as a stepping stool to reach the treasure, allowing you to get a Croaka Cola.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-lands-end-hidden-treasures-1.jpg><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>The first treasure in Land’s End is located by the floating platform in the first room.

After revealing the platform, use the cannon to launch yourself to it and hit the block on the leftmost corner of the ledge. Inside is another Croaka Cola.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-lands-end-hidden-treasures-4.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>The next Hidden Treasure is found in the grassy area with purple flowers.

When reaching a familiar room, this time with you on the upper ledge, you’ll need to jump on the visible ? block to get the treasure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-nimbus-land-hidden-treasures-1.jpg><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>The last Hidden Treasure in Nimbus Castle is only found after defeating Valentina. It’s in the room with the three doors, located in the uppermost corner of the area. This is the last of all Hidden Treasures to have a lasting reward in Super Mario RPG, meaning it’s the last one worth getting if you’re not going for 100% completion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mario-rpg-weapon-world-hidden-treasure.jpg><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>The very last Hidden Treasure you’ll have access to is in the Weapon World. It’s located next to the second Save Block of the location, in the left corner of the room. An instant-use Mushroom is inside, allowing you to heal before an upcoming boss fight.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>How to Meet Big Yoshi in the Super Mario RPG Remake</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Is There a Reward for Finding All Hidden Treasures in Super Mario RPG?</h2><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, even after finding all the Hidden Treasures in the game, Mario will not receive any substantial reward. At most, you can visit a Comeon in Monstro Town and it will express surprise at how you found every Hidden Treasure. Unlike <a href=#>getting 100 Super Jumps</a>, the only reward is simple satisfaction at your own persistence.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=false>Despite the lack of a final reward, nearly all Hidden Treasures in Super Mario RPG are useful in some way. In total, you’ll find 21 Frog Coins, 6 Croaka Colas, 4 instant-use Flowers, 3 Red Essences, 2 instant-use Mushrooms, a Rock Candy, and the unique Goodie Bag. Even if there isn’t a great reward for getting all Hidden Treasures in Super Mario RPG, it’s worthwhile to find them all simply for what’s inside of them.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
