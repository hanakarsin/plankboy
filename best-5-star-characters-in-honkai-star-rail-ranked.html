He is also one of the only characters in the game to be able to revive himself at E0.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>For those who were not able to get Bailu and thus get two healers, Gepard is also the only character currently in the game capable of excelling while filling in for a dedicated healer in the latter stages of the Forgotten Hall.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>With that said, although he has in his survivability his biggest strength (as expected of the game’s best tank), his inability to work in the early game given his low native speed and his subpar Energy generation makes him a niche character (at least for now).</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Honkai Star Rail: How to Re-Roll</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>9.

The counter can then be further enhanced by performing her Ultimate, which decreases the damage she takes and massively increases Svarog’s damage.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>For those still in the early game and thinking of rerolling after getting Clara, don’t, as she is the game’s most beginner-friendly 5-star, as well as one capable of successfully countering all kinds of enemies who rely on shields in the Simulated Universe.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>In order to bring the most out of her, using a shielder is obligatory.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>5.
