The roster of the game is still small enough to be able to understand each Pokémon’s strengths and weaknesses easily, but big enough to have as much variety needed for pleasant game sessions, and lots of theory-crafting. Which is what we did as well, and are now able to offer you some visibility at Pokémon UNITE’s early-stage’s tier list.</p><h2>Pokémon UNITE Tier List (July 2021)</h2><p>We categorize all currently available Pokémon in four different ranks, with S being the highest and C the lowest. As the roster expands further, it is more than likely that things and ranks will significantly change, and we will update everything accordingly. For the time being, here is the spot of every Pokémon you can use right now:</p><p><strong>S Rank</strong></p><ul><li>Absol</li><li>Pikachu</li><li>Zeraora</li><li>Eldegoss</li></ul><p>Undoubtedly, the kings and queens of Pokémon UNITE right now. All entries here are the best to their own, respective fields and are solid picks for anyone, without exception. Easy to use, but with results far exceeding their simple gameplay. All Pokémon here, bar Pikachu (kind of), lack some other utility other than having big damage and healing numbers, which is what keeps them from being utterly broken.</p><p><strong>A Rank</strong></p><ul><li>Talonflame</li><li>Snorlax</li><li>Alolan Ninetales</li><li>Slowbro</li><li>Mr. Mime</li><li>Cramorant</li><li>Greninja</li></ul><p>Pokémon in the A Rank tier, will be the ‘core’ of pretty much every team. You should expect each side to have at least two of these fellas here, as they may not be as overpowered as the guys in S Rank, but they offer solid stats, movesets and overall utility to the team. you can’t go wrong with any Pokémon here, so feel free to invest in them. By the way, and in my opinion, these here are also the most fun to use as well. Fun may not be a competitive factor, but considering the amount of time MOBA games tend to suck out of everyone, having fun with the units you use should elevate that excitement feeling and motivation to keep you playing for longer.</p><p><strong>B Rank</strong></p><ul><li>Cinderace</li><li>Garchomp</li><li>Gengar</li><li>Machamp</li><li>Venusaur</li></ul><p>As much as I’d like to place these entries here higher, especially my beloved four-armed macho dude, it’s hard to do so. Don’t take me wrong, they all do great work, however it’s hard to pick them over any of the Pokémon found in the tier above. They are good on what they do, each to their own, but more often than not you won’t be helping your team as much as with any of the previous Pokémon. That won’t stop me from maining Machamp though, so don’t be discouraged of using them, especially if you are planning on playing with friends, who can significantly raise a Pokémon’s tier as you can plan ahead your endgame. You’d be surprised what ‘low tier’ creatures can do.</p><p><strong>C Rank</strong></p><ul><li>Crustle</li><li>Wigglytuff</li><li>Lucario</li><li>Charizard</li></ul><p>I feel like this section is going to generate some hate, but what can I do. Unfortunately, and oddly enough for sure, many fan-favorites are here in this bottom tier, like Charizard and Lucario. Considering that some of the entries here have a huge amount of followers, you’d think that the devs would give them a small ‘boost’ to their overall kit. This is not the case though, and it was obvious since the beta that these Pokémon are in need of some tweaking. Again, like the entries of B and A tier, they can do what’s needed, however with a lot more effort and still with not as great results as the Pokémon above. Additionally, Pokémon here of the likes of Charizard, are great for beginners as they have easy to use gamestyles, but that is where they stay at. It’s hard to find some ‘next-level’ utility for any of the Pokémon here, as they just feel as they are missing something. Hopefully in the future we are going to see some balance changes that bring them over to higher ranks, and who knows, even send them to the fabled S tier.</p><p>To sum it up, we need to mention that none of the currently available Pokémon in Pokémon UNITE are ‘bad’, on the contrary, they are actually all enjoyable and helpful, but some more than others. As the roster gets bigger, we are going to have a better and clearer image of everyone’s capabilities, and for sure some spots will change. Until then, pick your poison and enjoy some exciting matches with your friends or players around the globe.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Pokémon UNITE</strong></a> is coming to Nintendo Switch on July 21, 2021 and to mobile devices in September 2021.
