This is not just a small update with a few bug fixes in it either, but a meaty update known as 30.5 overall that brings in the Sisters of Parvos. This follows up on <a href=#>update 30.1.0</a> from May. There is no shortage of content in this update, so we have provided the full patch notes for it. Here’s everything new with the Warframe update 2.00.</p><h2>Warframe Update 2.00 Patch Notes</h2><p dir=ltr><strong>SISTERS OF PARVOS</strong><br>Parvos Granum’s days of collecting grain are far behind him. His newest grand achievement, born of technology and a desire for family, has finally come to fruition. Modeled with the latest in Corpus advancements, the Sisters of Parvos are ready to claim their Sectors and your lives.</p><p>The Kuva Lich system, originally introduced in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Old Blood</a>&nbsp;update on Halloween of 2019, has expanded to introduce a new faction! The Sisters of Parvos update will bring your own personal Corpus adversary to the Origin System. Those acquainted with the Kuva Lich system will find familiarity with the Sisters of Parvos, but with a full Corpus experience!</p><p>A new cinematic awaits those who have finished The Call of The Tempestarii and The War Within…&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SISTERS OF PARVOS WEAPONS</strong><br>Be on the lookout for these coveted weapons wielded by your Sister of Parvos! Bestowed by Parvos Granum himself, there are 8 weapons in all to obtain!</p><p><strong>TENET ENVOY</strong><br>This discreet rocket launcher is equally at home in a board meeting or on a casual outing. Aimed rockets are wire-guided for greater accuracy, but travel more slowly. The patented Granum Attaché System reloads the weapon when holstered.</p><p><strong>TENET DIPLOS</strong><br>Itemize and execute with this pair of auto-lock-on, homing-projectile pistols. Shoot from-hip for a more conventional pistol experience. The patented Granum Attaché System reloads the pistols when holstered.</p><p><strong>TENET SPIREX</strong><br>Dominate rivals with this pistol’s lightning fast rail-slugs. Head-shots speed up reload.</p><p><strong>Primary Variants:<br>TENET TETRA</strong><br>Parvosian upgrade of the classic Tetra. Slower fire rate but with a larger magazine. Can now alt fire entire clip as a large burst radius grenade launcher.</p><p><strong>TENET FLUX RIFLE</strong><br>Sister-modified Flux Rifle with increased fire rate and range. Recharge has been replaced with ammo clips to accommodate greater power needs.</p><p><strong>TENET ARCA PLASMOR</strong><br>Custom variant of a Corpus classic. Staggering blasts now ricochet and have greater range at the cost of a slower fire and reload speed. Surviving enemies are consumed with radiation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Variants:</strong><br><strong>TENET CYCRON</strong><br>This reengineered Cycron features a refracting energy disc that can split off the main target hitting up to 2 additional nearby targets.</p><p><strong>TENET DETRON</strong><br>Parvos Granum’s engineers have made this already ferocious hand-cannon, even more deadly with addition of an alternate fire mode that empties an entire clip in one devastating burst.</p><p><strong>SISTERS OF PARVOS EPHEMERAS</strong><br>Seven New Ephemeras sporting a distinctly Corpus Style are here!</p><p><strong>SYBILLINA EPHEMERA</strong><br>Information flows like live current through this Ephemera seized from a converted or vanquished Sister of Parvos.</p><p><strong>ZARINA EPHEMERA</strong><br>A blazingly regal Ephemera seized from a converted or vanquished Sister of Parvos.</p><p><strong>GLORIANA EPHEMERA</strong><br>An icily imperious Ephemera seized from a converted or vanquished Sister of Parvos.</p><p><strong>LUCRETIA EPHEMERA</strong><br>Hatch venomous plots in this Ephemera seized from a converted or vanquished Sister of Parvos.</p><p><strong>HYPATIA EPHEMERA</strong><br>A radiant Ephemera seized from a converted or vanquished Sister of Parvos.</p><p><strong>KYRUNA EPHEMERA</strong><br>A striking Ephemera seized from a converted or vanquished Sister of Parvos.</p><p><strong>SOLENA EPHEMERA</strong><br>A magnetically compelling Ephemera seized from a converted or vanquished Sister of Parvos.</p><p><strong>HOUND COMPANIONS</strong><br>Each Corpus Sister comes with their very own Hound. As an added reward for Vanquishing your Sister, you’ll earn her Hound as your own Companion! There’s more, though! Hounds are also Modular Companions and in addition to earning your Sister’s Hound, there’s also a chance at a separate Hound Component to start the process of creating your truly customized Hound Companion! Each Hound you come across can have a subset of different Components (think MOA Companion Crafting).</p><p>Hound Component Blueprints are tradeable. Visit Legs in Fortuna to assemble a Hound Companion with your Components! Here you can also Provide your Hound to Legs for 4K Solaris United Standing. This amount is higher in comparison to MOA Companions due to the acquisition flow required for a Hound.</p><p>*Building a Hound includes a weapon, therefore requiring 2 Companion Slots.</p><p><strong>HOUND PRECEPTS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hound Precepts are rewarded based on the Model, Bracket, and Stabilizer chosen at Legs in Fortuna.</p><p>*Precept stats below are at max rank.</p><p><strong>Model Precepts:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hec Model – Equilibrium Audit Precept</strong><ul><li>Unleashes a series of shockwaves that knock down enemies within 15m and deal 300 damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Dorma Model – Repo Audit Precept</strong><ul><li>Emits a magnetic pulse that disarms enemies within 30m.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bhaira Model – Null Audit Precept</strong><ul><li>Negates the aura and abilities on an Eximus enemy and transfers the aura to the Hound for 60s.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Bracket Precepts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Urga Bracket – Diversified Denial Precept</strong><ul><li>Fabricates 3 Specters that fight for 30s that each deal 85% of the Hounds damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Zubb Bracket – Evasive Denial Precept</strong><ul><li>Teleports a safe distance away and engages a displacement field, gaining 75% chance to dodge enemy fire for 8s.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cela Bracket – Reflex Denial Precept</strong><ul><li>Generates a shield that reflects 90% damage taken (including friendly fire) in pulses over 10s as Magnetic Damage in a 12m radius.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Stabilizer Precepts:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hinta Stabilizer – Synergized Prospectus Precept</strong><ul><li>Fires a spark that seeks out the nearest enemy in 30m, dealing 300 Electricity Damage in a 10m radius.

The Melee weapon type is dependent on the Hound’s Model.</p><p><strong>Akaten (Hec Hound Model)</strong><br>Hound melee attacks eviscerate with Puncture and Slash damage.</p><p><strong>Batoten (Dorma Hound Model)</strong><br>Hound melee attacks pierce hard with Impact and Puncture damage.</p><p><strong>Lacerten (Bhaira Hound Model)</strong><br>Hound melee attacks devastate with Impact and Slash damage.</p><p><strong>NEW RESOURCE: SPECTRAL DEBRIS</strong><br>Discharged specter particles form an inert dust that can be collected and re-energized for various robotic projects.</p><p>Errant Specters in the Granum Void have a chance to drop Spectral Debris. This Resource is used in the Hound Component crafting process.&nbsp;<br><strong>NEW WARFRAME: YARELI</strong><br>Always on the move, the vivacious Yareli commands the ocean’s fury. The original waverider.</p><p><strong>PASSIVE</strong>: Yareli gains +100% Critical Chance for Secondary weapons when she has been moving for at least 1.5s.</p><p><strong>SEA SNARES</strong><br>Form three water globules that seek out enemies and expand on contact, simultaneously damaging and immobilizing their victims.</p><p><strong>MERULINA</strong><br>Summon Merulina, a rideable creature of the waves, and the inspiration for K-Driving.

Kuva Liches!</p><p>Be on the lookout for Kuva Larvlings with the following new weapons:</p><p><strong>KUVA HEK</strong><br>Forged at the behest of the Worm Queen herself, this already powerful shotgun now has the additional ability to fire from all four barrels simultaneously.</p><p><strong>KUVA GRATTLER</strong><br>Reconfigured for maximum lethality, the Kuva Grattler still shatters targets with explosive shells, but now reaches maximum fire-rate instantaneously.</p><p><strong>KUVA ZARR</strong><br>An even stronger Zarr cannon to meet the demands of Kuva Liches. With stronger explosive barrages, and long-range flak shots.</p><p><strong>LICH ADDITIONS, CHANGES & FIXES</strong></p><p><strong>Murmur Reduction</strong><br>With the addition of the Sisters of Parvos to the Lich system we took another look at the overall Murmur requirement from a few angles: how the current Murmur requirement applied to Sisters and how it felt with the current Kuva Liches.</p><p>As a result,&nbsp;<strong>we’ve reduced the Murmur requirements so that getting all 3 Requiems solely by killing Thralls should be about 12-13 missions on average, down from 18-19 average.</strong></p><p><strong>Region Consistency for Matchmaking improvements</strong></p><p>We have changed the way you progress against your Lich by having consistent Influence regions per level of your Lich!.</p><p>The problem we aim to solve here is scattered matchmaking for players seeking Murmurs overall. Players would often have the same goal but never cross paths due to their Liches separation across the Origin System.</p><p>The details of this change are:</p><p>1) Rank 1 Kuva Liches appear on Earth<br>2) Rank 2 Kuva Liches appear on Mars<br>3) Rank 3 Kuva Liches appear on Ceres<br>4) Rank 4 Kuva Liches appear on Sedna<br>5) Rank 5 Kuva Liches appear on the Kuva Fortress</p><p>*Please note: if you had an Active Lich before the Update, it’ll progress through its current occupation nodes before it adopts the new Region flow.</p><p><strong>New Requiem Mod – OULL&nbsp;</strong><br>Through endless faces, countless forms, a multitude unfolds.<br>(Mimics any Requiem Mod needed to complete a lethal sequence)</p><p>This new Oull Requiem Mod counts as the correct Requiem Sequence for whatever Parazon Requiem slot it is in when taking down a Lich or Sister of Parvos! Like other Requiem Mods, the Oull can be used successfully 3 times.</p><p>Earn this new Requiem as a 25% drop chance when your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos flees after you’ve used the correct Requiem Sequence. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.</p><p><strong>New REQUIEM ULTIMATUM</strong><br>Take control of your nemesis with the new<strong>&nbsp;REQUIEM ULTIMATUM</strong>&nbsp;– a call too powerful to resist! A new Gear item that can be used to spawn your current active Kuva Lich or Sister on an Influence Node to bring the fight to you! Our intention here is to add an option to force the feud in your favor.</p><p>Earn this Requiem Ultimatum as a 25% drop chance when choosing to either Convert or Vanquish your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.</p><p><strong>New Kuva Lich Showdown Flow</strong></p><p><strong>Do you and your Squad have what it takes to beat your Kuva Lich Showdown?</strong></p><p>Kuva Liches have also received the new boss showdown flow in Railjack! Your Kuva Lich will now flee to their Galleon&nbsp;<strong>once you’ve weakened them with the correct Requiem sequence.</strong>&nbsp;Once you’ve unlocked their Requiem, a new showdown node will appear within the Saturn Proxima (minimum Intrinsic 5). You and any other Tenno who have&nbsp;<strong>weakened</strong>&nbsp;Liches will be able to seek out and destroy!</p><p>Our intent behind this change is to match our TennoCon 2019 Lich Showdown presentation. In doing this, we’ve also eliminated the randomness of that final showdown. These are&nbsp;<strong>guaranteed fights that you can gear up before you go in! Bring your best gear for the job.</strong></p><p>Between reducing the required Murmurs, adding OULL, adding Requiem Ultimatums, and having this new flow, we have shortened the Kuva Lich cycle and added more control for all Tenno! The final fight is now on your terms, and we hope you enjoy the efforts to improve and simplify this system!</p><p><strong>Kuva Lich (And Sister of Parvos) Valence Fusion QOL:</strong></p><p>We have made Valence Fusion for Weapons more intuitive in this Update! We are inheriting the behaviour we added for Railjack which was much more clear to our players!</p><ul><li>Prior to this Update, when you used Valence Fusion to combine two Kuva Lich weapons together in the Arsenal, the&nbsp;<strong>order</strong>&nbsp;of the weapons picked would determine which&nbsp;<strong>element</strong>&nbsp;the final bonus damage would be.</li><li>In this update, when you combine two Kuva Lich weapons (or Sister Tenet weapons) together,<strong>&nbsp;you will have the option of which element you want to keep.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerical stat of the element still combines using the same logic as previously.<ul><li>This is intended to reduce confusion about the end result you will get, and to make it easier to keep a desired element. Now you don’t need to fuse twice to restore your initial element type if you are combining weapons with different elements.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Adaptive Damage Scaling Changes for Liches:</strong></p><p>Throughout our boss design history, we have added things like diminishing returns and damage mitigation techniques like armor or damage attenuation. In the time since we’ve launched the Kuva Liches, we’ve made adjustments to how we handle player damage vs. Liches. We’ve done things like add allowing&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Status Effects and attenuate damage</a>&nbsp;to try and create a balanced combat experience. Like many bosses in Warframe, Liches have some damage modifiers applied to them.</p><p>We found a bug in the damage attenuation code, and have fixed it and polished the attenuation for Kuva Liches.</p><p>This system generally targets the scenario of very high damage things like the Void Rig’s Arquebex vs. a Kuva Lich, a scenario that is now possible due to the final showdown being based in Railjack. When we were testing this Voidrig Vs Lichout, our Liches barely lasted a second and we realized the damage attenuation code could use some review! We found bugs to fix and things to tweak to account for these new scenarios. Our only intention is to give you a fight that lasts more than mere seconds – happy hunting and may your teamwork and gear lead you to victory! We will be closely reviewing this to ensure we strike the right balance of a fight that requires teamwork and consistent offensive gameplay to beat, but also doesn’t feel impossible. Feedback is welcome!</p><p><strong>General Lich Changes & Fixes:</strong></p><ul><li>Updated the Lich Tutorial screen to include new Lich flow and Sisters related information.</li><li>Changed the “Captured Liches” category to “Converted Adversaries” in the Trade window.</li><li>If you do not have any Kuva Lich or Sisters of Parvos history in your Codex, a pop-up message will appear to tell you that you have not encountered any.</li><li>Added new Kuva Lich transmissions for the following scenarios:<ul><li>Lich Defeated Player Taunt</li><li>Lich Downed Player</li><li>Lich Kills Player</li></ul></li><li>Fixed failing Requiem Mods sequence affecting the appearance of other players’ Kuva Liches.</li><li>Fixed holding the Parazon as if it was a sidearm if a Host migration occurred during the Kuva Lich Parazon stab animation.</li><li>Fixed instances where Parazon would become invisible or not animating during Kuva Lich attempts.</li><li>Fixed getting stuck in other players’ Kuva Lich stab cinematics.</li></ul><p><strong>PARAZON REWORK</strong></p><p>Parazon attacks were introduced in The Old Blood as a way to Mercy kill enemies. This stylish and universal blade has had a clear role in all things Liches, but their role in the game at large has been hard to play around. There are problems in need of solving, and the below outlines how we’ve done just that!</p><p>The problem with Mercy kills is they are hard to pull off, making engagement with the system far too low! Mercy kills only have<strong>&nbsp;a chance</strong>&nbsp;to trigger when an enemy’s health is 20% HP or less. In practice, you really never know if it’s going to happen. And if it does, it is often too late! You’ve riddled them with Status effects, a Squadmate casts an Ability, or your Kavat might be feeling extra bloodthirsty, and you cannot get in for the Mercy kill.</p><p>We are changing their design, adding new Mods (thanks Design Council!), and refreshing the system.</p><p>The change is based on a core principle: We want to make them more<strong>&nbsp;reliable and more strategic so you can actively decide if you want to use a Mercy kill or not.</strong></p><p>Our change is rooted<strong>&nbsp;in the following:</strong></p><p><strong>A Mercy Kill opportunity is guaranteed when an enemy gets below 40% (60% for Corpus, but requires all Shields being stripped), but only on SPECIFIC units in each faction.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The units are:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>All humanoid Eximus</li><li>Grineer<ul><li>Heavy Gunners</li><li>Bombards</li></ul></li><li>Corpus<ul><li>Scrambus</li><li>Nullifiers</li></ul></li><li>Infested<ul><li>Ancients</li></ul></li></ul><p>And the logic is rooted in the following common scenario:</p><p><strong>Imagine you see a heavy gunner in the distance. You have “Blood for Energy” on your Parazon. You see you need some Energy, so you start shooting the heavy gunner knowing full well once she’s at 40%, she will be open for a Mercy kill and the Energy could be yours!</strong></p><p>You can plan and decide!</p><p><strong>This also means that Impact Status Effect is changing:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Before:</strong>&nbsp;Impact Status Effects used to increase the chance that the random Mercy kill opportunity &nbsp;would happen.</p><p><strong>After:</strong>&nbsp;Impact Status Effects increases the Mercy Kill threshold range on eligible enemies. So instead of triggering at 40% on the list above, you can apply Impact Status to do a Mercy kill sooner (4% per Status)… up to 80%. Meaning, applying a lot of Impact Status quickly makes an enemy VIP more quickly susceptible to a Mercy Kill. Impact would then be a build strategy for getting the VIPs out of the fight!</p><p>But what about really high levels you ask?</p><p>We have made changes to this since our original Developer Workshop.</p><p>Up until level 150, the Parazon Finisher triggers at 40% Health remaining.<br>After that, every 5 levels reduces the threshold by 1%, down to a minimum of 10%! Eligible Enemy Health bars will have a notch on them to indicate these thresholds..</p><p>This change was made to make it more clear to our players, as well as still approach guaranteed kills at high levels with an amount of balance.</p><p><strong>In addition, since Parazons were reworked, Zephyr’s Airburst no longer overlaps with finishers.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>VOID STORM REWARDS UPDATE & NEW TENET MELEE WEAPONS</strong><br>Long lost&nbsp;<strong>CORRUPTED HOLOKEYS</strong>&nbsp;have been discovered in the raging Void Storms! Millions of these Holokeys were lost to the Void when Parvos Granum’s flagship was bombed. Perrin Sequence’s own Ergo Glast has a strong desire for these artifacts, and is offering up new Granum weapon technology for them (Syndicate alliance not required)!</p><p>Each Proxima Void Storm can reward Corrupted Holokeys as Common mission rewards. These replace the End of Mission Void Trace rewards from Void Storms.</p><p>EARTH VOID STORM<br>2x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%</p><p>VENUS VOID STORM<br>2x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%</p><p>SATURN VOID STORM<br>4x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%</p><p>NEPTUNE VOID STORM<br>3x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%</p><p>PLUTO VOID STORM<br>5x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%</p><p>VEIL PROXIMA VOID STORM<br>6x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%</p><p>Visit Ergo Glast in a Relay and view his new weekly Merchandise. Every week Ergo will have 1x version of each new Tenet Melee weapon with its additional bonus Damage / Elemental for 40 Corrupted Holokeys.</p><p>By visiting Ergo each week with Corrupted Holokeys in hand you can collect them all to Valence Transfer week over week until you get the best possible version of each weapon. If collecting is more your style then Ergo will always have something in stock!</p><p><strong>Ergo Glast’s Merchandise:</strong></p><p><strong>TENET AGENDUS</strong><br>Drive the agenda with this massive impact hammer. Heavy attacks launch devastating energy disks.</p><p><strong>TENET EXEC</strong><br>Leverage bleeding-edge Granum tech with this massive heavy blade. Slam sends forth a cascading set of three shockwaves, while Heavy Slam unleashes a swath of shockwaves.</p><p><strong>TENET LIVIA</strong><br>The sleek lines of the Granum Attaché case conceal a infinitely sharp two-handed blade. Blocked attacks have a chance to increase the blocking angle. Note: The Granum Attaché system pauses the combo timer when holstered. Similar to the Xoris, if you have a Melee weapon with infinite combo duration, pseudo-melee abilities consume the Combo on use.</p><p><strong>TENET GRIGORI</strong><br>On Heavy Slide Attack this Corpus scythe launches a spinning energy disk that ricochets throughout the battlefield. Its lifetime is derived from the size of the Combo Counter. Note: The Granum Attaché system pauses the combo timer when holstered. Similar to the Xoris, if you have a Melee weapon with infinite combo duration, pseudo-melee abilities consume the Combo on use.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>RAILJACK ADDITIONS, CHANGES & FIXES</strong></p><ul><li dir=ltr><p dir=ltr><strong>RAILJACK COMMAND RANK 10:</strong>&nbsp;Introducing&nbsp;<strong>Elite Crewmates!</strong>&nbsp;Stronger crew members become available for recruitment from Ticker.</p><ul><li dir=ltr><p dir=ltr>These Elite Crewmates have two more Competency Points and they have a random trait based on which of their Competencies have the most points.</p><ul><li dir=ltr><p dir=ltr>For example: If their Gunnery skills have the most Competency Points, this Crew member could have “50% more damage with Zetki weapons”.

Our stated goals were to move away from long endurance missions as the most efficient way to collect Steel Essence, while also reducing randomness. After observing player trends, a loot strategy involving both of these elements has come up once again, making regular unoptimized Steel Path play feel less worthwhile.</p><p>With the number of new Steel Path rewards being introduced in this update, we wanted to address those strategies, while also bringing up the lower average. We hope these changes reinforce one of this update’s main themes – you should be able to play the game however you want, without feeling forced into prevalent strategies.</p><ul><li>Acolytes will now spawn more frequently during Steel Path missions, resulting in more Steel Essence being dropped overall!</li><li>Steel Path Incursions will each offer a reward of 5 Steel Essence, increased from 3.</li><li>Steel Essence will now remain on the ground for 5 minutes before disappearing. If the UI marker is blinking, be sure to get it before it’s gone!</li><li>For consistency, Vitus Essence follows the same rules and will remain on the ground for 5 minutes before disappearing.</li><li>Acolytes will now be teleported to a safe location if pulled into water. This fixes Itzal’s Cosmic Crush pulling Acolytes into water volumes where they instantly died.</li><li>Fixed Acolyte spawns becoming extremely slow or stopping altogether in specific Steel Path mission types – most commonly reproduced in Disruption or Survival.</li></ul><p>Acolytes will now drop 1 of 6 New Arcanes on death!</p><p>PRIMARY MERCILESS<br>On Kill:<br>+30% Damage for 4s.

Not all weapons are built equal, but ideally there are several answers to each query, so that Tenno can make their own choices from a variety of options and keep things fresh. If one category of weapons outclasses all the others, or makes them feel redundant, then we as developers want to step in to make sure choice exists for the sake of fun.</p><p>Enter melee weapons, and equally importantly, the Mods you can use on them. Tenno have spent years sharpening their blades, but as a result, we’ve seen Primary and Secondary weapons collecting rust. And the longer we avoid addressing it, the worse this divide will become.</p><p>We are changing Melee and Primary in for the singular purpose of making the combat experience more balanced,&nbsp;<strong>especially at high level play (Steel Path, etc).&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Generally speaking, we feel that gun stats are in a good place, but it’s the Mods that are lacking. Inversely, some Melee Mods are too strong. We intend to address these issues in two ways: firstly,&nbsp;<strong>careful nerfs to a handful of Melee Mods</strong>; secondly,&nbsp;<strong>by offering greater strength for the rest of your Arsenal with Primary and Secondary Arcanes and new Galvanized Mods. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our goal is to encourage you to use your entire Arsenal in-mission. Switching between Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapons should feel like valid and strategic options, in contrast to the uncontested Melee dominance that exists in the current meta. We want Melee to be fun and powerful as you rip and tear your way through the solar system but we want players to have that same level of fun and power with Primary and Secondary weapons should that be their preference.</p><p>The option to choose is key here — one that is lessened by the current divide between Melee and everything else. Our approach to lessen this divide will be through changes to existing Mods, the addition of new&nbsp;<strong>Mods</strong>, as well as introducing new Primary and Secondary Weapon Upgrades.</p><p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Melee Mod Nerfs</li><li>Weapon Changes</li><li>Primary and Secondary Weapon Arcanes</li><li>Galvanized Mods</li><li>Login Items</li></ul><p><u><strong>Melee Mod Nerfs</strong></u></p><p>We have 5 categories of changes coming:</p><p><strong>Berserker<br>Bloodrush<br>Condition Overload<br>Glaives<br>Kuva Nukor</strong></p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong></p><p>Attack Speed increases for Melee are part of what makes it so dominant. This is especially true when the conditions to reach animation-breaking Attack Speed are as simple as current Berserker: ‘on Critical Hit’. Infinite Attack-Speed Uptime is possible with a single Mod, and the result is animation noise with no distinction between hits, coupled with massive Damage output.</p><p>We still want to support the ability to increase your Melee Attack Speed and Damage Output, just not to the levels you currently can.</p><p>Berserker is changing from:<br>+30% Attack Speed (Max 75%) for 24s on Critical Hit</p><p>To:<br>Berserker Fury, cannot stack with Fury.<br>On Melee Kill:<br>+35% Attack Speed (Max 70%) &nbsp;for 10s. Stacks up to 2x.</p><p>This is important because:</p><p>– It decouples it from Critical Chance.<br>– Adds a more defined ramp up using ‘On Kill’ instead of On Crit (which frequently meant 0 to ‘Max’ in one swing hitting 3 enemies).<br>– Renamed to Berserker Fury to communicate that it can no longer be equipped with Fury / Primed Fury.</p><p><strong>Blood Rush:</strong></p><p>Blood Rush’s maximum value is being lowered.This changes the achievability of consistent Red Crits from just one Mod (on most Melee weapons, some High-Critical exceptions), and now additional help will be needed via Mods, Arcanes, or Warframe abilities to achieve consistent Red Crits.</p><p>One Mod alone generally delivering the best tier of Criticals felt too powerful.</p><p>Blood Rush is changing from:<br>+60% Critical Chance stacks with Combo Multiplier</p><p>To<br>+40% Critical Chance stacks with Combo Multiplier</p><p><strong>Condition Overload:</strong></p><p>Condition Overload’s maximum value is being lowered. It’s been some time since we originally changed this Mod, and in this time we’ve decided we’re still not happy with the way this goes up against other Damage Mods (namely Primed Pressure Point). We’ve reduced this to 80% to make it almost as good as Primed Pressure Point, and 3 Status Types back to where it was originally. It remains true that&nbsp;<strong>even though the maximum potential damage is lower now, we think it is still an extremely powerful Mod in its latest iteration.</strong></p><p>There should now be a more meaningful choice: do you want front loaded damage or a build up from multiple Status Types?</p><p>Condition Overload is changing from:<br>+120% Melee Damage per Status Type affecting the target.</p><p>To<br>+80% Melee Damage per Status Type affecting the target.<br><u><strong>Weapon Changes&nbsp;</strong></u></p><p><strong>Glaives</strong></p><p>In late 2020, we reworked the Glaive melee class to be more powerful and comfortable to use. Overall, we feel these changes had their intended effect as weapons like the Glaive Prime skyrocketed from obscurity to the top of the pile with their newfound ability to inflict huge damage using heavy attacks.</p><p>However, these changes also introduced a common issue: players with high melee attack speed would sometimes accidentally throw their Glaives when trying to perform simple melee strikes, and the “catch and release” mechanic sometimes resulted in multiple unintended throws. In reviewing our Melee system, we felt it was a good opportunity to address this concern, while also doing a balancing pass to reflect the power in this newly reworked melee class.</p><p>That said, our two changes to Glaives go hand in hand:</p><p>First,&nbsp;<strong>the heavy attack wind-up speed is being increased from 0.6 seconds to 1.2 seconds.</strong>&nbsp;With more time on the wind-up, it is much harder to accidentally throw when you are trying to swing.</p><p>With this increased wind-up speed, players are also more capable of performing quick throws. Right now the damage on quick throws is very close to fully charged, so in order to encourage more meaningful choice, our second change is to&nbsp;<strong>reduce quick throw damage to approximately 50% of the maximum charge.</strong>&nbsp;Exact number changes are as follows:</p><p>Cerata<br>Direct Hit Damage from 366 to 201<br>Radial Damage from 549 to 333</p><p>Falcor<br>Direct Hit Damage from 460 to 250<br>Radial Damage from 690 to 345</p><p>Glaive<br>Direct Hit Damage from 210 to 116<br>Radial Damage from 315 to 190</p><p>Glaive Prime<br>Direct Hit Damage from 328 to 180<br>Radial Damage from 492 to 296</p><p>Halikar<br>Direct Hit Damage from 298 to 163<br>Radial Damage from 447 to 225</p><p>Halikar Wraith<br>Direct Hit Damage from 503 to 263<br>Radial Damage from 621 to 329</p><p>Kestrel<br>Direct Hit Damage from 168 to 92<br>Radial Damage from 252 to 126</p><p>Orvius<br>Direct Hit Damage from 390 to 215<br>Radial Damage from to 520 to 293</p><p>Pathocyst<br>Direct Hit Damage from 524 to 288<br>Radial Damage from 786 to 393</p><p>Xoris<br>Direct Hit Damage from 240 to 120<br>Radial Damage from 480 to 250</p><p><strong>Kuva Nukor</strong></p><p>We are indeed touching 1 non-Melee item in the series of Nerfs, and likely to no one’s surprise it’s the Kuva Nukor. It’s a dominant Secondary with incredible power, which is warranted given its acquisition. It’ll keep all of its signature behaviour, but the general output is being notched down slightly with the following change:<br>– Chains targets reduced to 2 from 4</p><p><strong>Vermisplicer</strong></p><p>Reduced the Vermisplicers tendril chains from 5 to 3.</p><p>After the original publication of our Dev Workshop, we observed and noted that the Vermisplicer’s behaviour is very similar to the Kuva Nukor. To this end, we wanted to ensure we were consistent in handling the beam chain weapons in this update.</p><p><strong>Onward to Primary & Secondary…</strong></p><p>With all the information about how we are lessening power in some ways, let’s move onto the way we are increasing the power available to Primary & Secondary weapon options.</p><p><u><strong>Primary and Secondary Weapon Arcanes</strong></u></p><p>We are going to start with the biggest change:&nbsp;<strong>You can now add Arcane Slots (name not final) to your Primary and Secondary weapons</strong>, and fill the Slots with&nbsp;<strong>new Arcanes that enhance and reward diverse gameplay.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Our entire approach to making Guns a comparable choice in your Arsenal orbits around the notion that Gunplay is fundamentally more varied than Melee: there are pinpoint accuracy guns, AOE guns, and high fire rate Guns (and everything in between).</strong>&nbsp;There’s reload times, magazine sizes, and more. We want to make these varied options better at what they do by rewarding you for using them well – thus, Arcanes!</p><p>Because the Gunplay falloff is more of a late-game problem, these new Upgrades will be earned through late-game content systems — namely, the Steel Path. You’ll be able to get the Arcane Slot Unlockers from Steel Path Honors, whereas the Arcanes themselves drop from Acolytes in the Steel Path! The spawn frequency of Acolytes is also being increased, meaning you’ll get more Steel Essence, as well as more chances for the Arcane you want. All Acolytes will drop them!</p><p>There are 6 Arcanes (3 Primary, 3 Secondary) that you’ll be able to rank up and put to put into the new Slots:</p><p><strong>PRIMARY:</strong><br>The first Primary Arcane is designed with Primary weapons that perform well as AOE or high rate-of-fire weapons. This Arcane will reward kills with the following stats at Max rank:</p><p><strong>PRIMARY MERCILESS</strong><br>On Kill:<br>+30% Damage for 4s. Stacks up to 12x.<br>+30% Reload Speed<br>+100% Ammo Max</p><p>The more you kill, the more damage you can build up. Groovy!</p><p>The second Primary Arcane is designed with high precision weapons in mind. Make your Headshots count for greater performance (excluding AOE headshots)!:</p><p><strong>PRIMARY DEADHEAD</strong><br>On Headshot Kill:<br>120% Damage for 24s. Stacks up to 3x.<br>+30% to Headshot Multiplier.<br>-50% Weapon Recoil</p><p>The final Primary Arcane is designed with using your full loadout in mind, enter Melee synergy:</p><p><strong>PRIMARY DEXTERITY</strong><br>On Melee Kill: +60% Damage for 20s. Stacks up to 6x. +60% Holster Speed. +7.5s Combo Duration.</p><p><strong>SECONDARY:&nbsp;</strong><br>Secondary Weapons will receive the same options as Primary Weapons for their Arcanes, but with their own version. In practice, you’d be able to equip yourself with a Precision Secondary like the Knell, a high-fire rate Primary like the Grakata, and select the Arcane that will reward each play style best!</p><p>The stats are the same for the Secondary versions of the New Arcanes:</p><p><strong>SECONDARY MERCILESS</strong><br>On Kill:<br>+30% Damage for 4s. Stacks up to 12x.<br>+30% Reload Speed<br>+100% Ammo Max</p><p><strong>SECONDARY DEADHEAD</strong><br>On Headshot Kill:<br>120% Damage for 24s. Stacks up to 3x.<br>+30% to Headshot Multiplier.<br>-50% Weapon Recoil</p><p><strong>SECONDARY DEXTERITY</strong><br>On Melee Kill: +60% Damage for 20s. Stacks up to 6x. +60% Holster Speed. +7.5s Combo Duration.</p><p>Ultimately each Arcane stacks up to the same amount of damage, but it’s how you choose to get there that counts. Precision? Spray and Pray? Melee synergy? Your choice!</p><p>The “Arcane Adapters themselves are an item you’ll need to install on the weapons you want to take further, and you can find the Primary and Secondary Arcane Adapters in the Steel Path Honors. The Arcanes themselves drop from Acolytes on The Steel Path.<br><u><strong>Galvanized Mods</strong></u></p><p>Our observation that Arsenal imbalance becomes obvious at higher level content means that we want your progression to this content to matter for your power level. We want to give you the tools to progress to optimal play with a new series of Mods: Galvanized Mods!</p><p>The general approach to these Galvanized Mods is that the&nbsp;<strong>unconditional</strong>&nbsp;upgrade is not quite as good as the non-Galvanized original, but the<strong>&nbsp;On Kill</strong>&nbsp;conditional increases them well above and beyond what is available with ‘conventional’ Mods in your Arsenal. These will be available from Arbitrations for Vitus Essence.</p><ul><li>New Galvanized Mods:<ul><li>Galvanized Crosshairs</li><li>Galvanized Diffusion</li><li>Galvanized Shot</li><li>Galvanized Scope</li><li>Galvanized Chamber</li><li>Galvanized Aptitude</li><li>Galvanized Hell</li><li>Galvanized Acceleration</li><li>Galvanized Savvy</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>General Beam Weapon Mod Change:</strong><br>Ruinous Extension and Sinister Reach are now slottable in the Exilus slot and their text changed from “+X Range” to “+X Beam Length”</p><p>Why: While we are in the revision process for all things Mods, some well reasoned suggestions made it aboard!</p><p><u><strong>Login Items&nbsp;</strong></u></p><p>As with many of our large-scale reworks and changes in the past, we want to honour the investment of time and resources our players have put into their Arsenal! Since these changes are both wide-sweeping and precise, we have a general login inbox planned for all players, with a few bonuses for those who meet certain conditions.</p><p>With the release of Update 30.5: Sisters of Parvos, players will receive the following upon login:</p><li>All Players Mastery Rank 5 and above will receive 5 x Built Forma.</li><li>All Players Mastery Rank 5 and above will receive a 3-Day Affinity Booster.</li><li>Any Player who owns a Kuva Nukor will receive an extra 2 x Built Forma.</li><li>All Players who owned ANY Lich Weapon at any point OR have a Converted Lich OR have an active Lich get 1x Requiem Ultimatum (a new item to taunt a Lich or Sister into battle)!</li><li>Players who have Converted a Kuva lich OR vanquished a Kuva Lich will get OULL, which is a Requiem Wildcard Mod!</li><p><strong>In closing…</strong></p><p>The delivery of these changes is rooted in our goals, and if we miss the mark we’ll be watching for what to tweak. Keep in mind what our goals and visions are when you give feedback after playing!</p><p><strong>GENERAL MOD CHANGES</strong></p><ul><li>Critical Delay – Critical Chance from 187% to 200% -36% fire rate to -20% fire rate</li><li>Creeping Bullseye – Critical Chance from 187% to 200% -36% fire rate to -20% fire rate</li><li>Critical Deceleration – Critical Chance from 48% to 200% -30% fire rate to -20% fire rate can no longer stack with Blunderbuss/Primed Blunderbuss*** If we release that… ;) Maybe.</li><li>Cautious Shot increased from 90% to 100%</li></ul><p><strong>DECONSTRUCTOR MELEE MODDING CHANGES:</strong></p><p>The Sisters of Parvos update will bring three new Modular Hound Companions, each with a unique Melee weapon. While reviewing these Companion Weapons, we noticed the Helios-old problem that there’s a lot of Melee Mods that you can equip, but don’t really function on companion Melee. There’s also some ‘invisible gear hopping’ where if you put Mods on your Deconstructor (or Prime), they carry over to your Melee which is a many-year-old oversight we’ve lived with, but are approaching changes more thoroughly with this Update and as a result we’re patching up this behaviour.</p><p>These are mostly Mods that deal with combos or heavy attacks, since Companions do not have these features as well as other certain outliers. As a result the following Mods will be incompatible with the upcoming three Hound weapons and retroactively will no longer work with the Deconstructor and Deconstructor Prime:</p><p>Amalgam Organ Shatter<br>Corrupt Charge<br>Enduring Strike<br>Body Count<br>Blood Rush<br>Dispatch Overdrive<br>Drifting Contact<br>Energy Channel<br>Finishing Touch<br>Focus Energy<br>Focused Defense<br>Guardian Derision<br>Killing Blow<br>Life Strike<br>Maiming Strike<br>Parry<br>Quickening<br>Reflex Coil<br>Relentless Combination<br>Seismic Wave<br>True Punishment<br>Weeping Wounds</p><p>Gladiator Might<br>Gladiator Rush<br>Gladiator Vice<br>Carnis Mandible<br>Jugulus Barbs<br>Saxum Thorax<br>Motus Impact<br>Proton Snap<br>Tek Gravity<br>Strain Infection</p><p><strong>HELMINTH UPDATES:</strong><br>You can now go up to Rank 15, and so much more! When it comes to the level cap increase to Helminth (from 10 to 15), we are introducing Invigorations at the same time, which will give around triple the XP of Subsumes.

With a combination of Community feedback and internal desires we’ve changed the following:</p><p><strong>Genetic Aging Regressing</strong><br>Within the Incubator you can now choose to “Regress Genetic Aging” of an existing Mature Companion back to their non-mature state (puppy, kitten, etc). Keep in mind that this unequips said Companion (if it was equipped) and it’s Armor/cosmetics are removed. At any time you can choose to Mature said Companion at which it will revert to its former Mature state with its existing Levels, stats, and Armor/cosmetics intact. There’s no limit to how many times you can Regress your Companion!</p><p><strong>Stability & Loyalty Removal</strong><br>We have removed the DNA Integrity and Loyalty groups from the Companion Management Screen, and removed DNA Stabilizers from the Market. Previously only the Nutrio Incubator Upgrade Segment could eliminate DNA degradation.&nbsp;<strong>No more Stability or Loyalty degrading!</strong></p><p><strong>Damage Resistance Mod Math Changes:</strong></p><p>The following changes occurred due to the following scenario being shared:</p><p>A player reported that combining Umbral Mods + Adaptation + Lightning Rod on any Warframe made them fully immune to all damage from the Hydrolyst Eidolon.</p><p>Prior to this discovery, we already made sure we couldn’t reach 100% Damage Resistance because that would just be excessive in all cases. You can see this in action when we capped the ‘In Air’ Damage Resistance Mods. Even though the Mods theoretically could reach 100% Damage Resistance, there is a hard cap at 90%.</p><p>In response and to avoid future oversights, we have changed the way Damage Resistance works. It now works on ‘Damage Remaining’&nbsp;<strong>instead</strong>&nbsp;of having all the Modifiers combined and operating at once.</p><p><strong>Example:<br>Consider the case of:<br>4x 25% Damage Resistance Mods:</strong></p><p><strong>WAS:</strong>&nbsp;(25% + 25% + 25% + 25%) = 100% Damage Reduction</p><p>0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 = 31.5% damage taken AKA 68.5% damage reduction</p><p><strong>NEW DEIMOS ENEMY: JUGULUS REX</strong><br>These enhanced enemies don’t appear for just anyone!
