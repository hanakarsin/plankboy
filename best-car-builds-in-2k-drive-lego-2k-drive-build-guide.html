The car builder feature in LEGO 2K Drive is vast and I was excited to see that it was like that when I first got to try it. This article will take you through everything you need to know about making the best LEGO 2K Drive car builds.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Best LEGO 2K Drive Car Builds | Tips for Making the Best Cars</h2><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>In order to make the best car builds you have a few options on how to go about doing so. For one, <strong>you could modify existing pre-built cars/vehicles in the garage</strong> such as the “Out for the Count” car if you have it which already has excellent perks. You then could bring its weight down by removing bricks from it and allow you to get even speedier with your turns.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>I personally think that the modification process of cars is a great way to use the general building features in Lego 2K Drive. To start with this you can do so by following these steps:</p><li>Visit a Garage</li><li>Hover over a vehicle you’d like to modify in the showroom and select it</li><li>Press the “Modify” button</li><li>This will create a full new copy for you to edit as you please</li><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO 2K Drive Trophies and Achievements Listed</a></p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>When building a custom vehicle you will want to ensure that you <strong>keep an eye on how many bricks the car has and what its overall weight is</strong>. This can be seen in the top-right of the screen. <strong>The heavier a car is, the more it could encounter issues with general maneuverability</strong>. We would recommend keeping between a medium to an optimized heavy weight of a car. Having perks will assist you with that.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>When you finish a car you can also choose to “Test Drive” it to get a better feel of the car. If you have made any large edits we would recommend timing yourself from one end of the track to the other and adjusting parts as necessary on the car to get faster times. You can also choose to <strong>look at the stats of the vehicle where you can buy some stats such as “Strong Pedal” from the “Awesome” category</strong>.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Tutorials, Tutorials, Tutorials</h4><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Another great way to get ahead of the curve with your building process is to follow the dedicated tutorials the game has based on building. These can be accessed by opening the pause menu in the garage and clicking “Tutorial”. After you are there, scroll to the “Master Class” section and go through some of those. Not only that but if you have a car that is especially speedy then you can rebuild it through a tutorial.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>I love doing this and you can also follow that process by selecting a vehicle and then pressing “Instructions”. If you have ever built LEGO before in real life then it is essentially that but a digitized version of it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Fix “Your Vehicle Has Some Problems” in Lego 2K Drive</h3><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>If like us you have encountered the “Your Vehicle Has Some Problems error then you can rest assured that it can be fixed. <strong>Whatever the red error message is at the bottom of the screen, follow what that tells you to fix the issue</strong>. Usually, this tends to be about “floating bricks” and <strong>in order to fix this you will have to move the Pink Outlined bricks</strong> (any brick with an outline that isn’t at your cursor) to on top of another brick.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO 2K Drive is getting a four-season ‘Drive Pass’</a></p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>In order to move bricks, you can select a brick and then use the “Move Selected” button. You can then drag a brick about from that point and <strong>place it on top of any brick that already has a solid base underneath it</strong> — this will solve the message about vehicle problems that you got.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Start Building Vehicles in LEGO 2K Drive</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Build-Cars-in-LEGO-2K-Drive.jpg><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>In order to start building vehicles you will have to proceed through the tutorial section until you unlock garages: at that point, you can visit any Garage in the world to begin building your cars. If you want to build new cars all you have to do is open your map and look for any Wrench icon. You can either fast-travel there or make your way via the roads.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Does LEGO 2K Drive Have Crossplay?</a></p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Now that you know how to make the best car builds and where to actually make them, you are equipped with all the knowledge you need for building in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lego 2K Drive</a>.
