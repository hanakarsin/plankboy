Let yourself be heard.</span></li></ul></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>The ladies have been giving me the cold shoulder, of late, I believe it is because they are intimidated by my noble presence.

I’m never gonna get full on stupid leaves!</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Eating vegetables will help your muscles grow.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>That was a fascinating lecture, but now my brain is fried. I feel like I need a change of pace to reinvigorate me. What do you recommend?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Try going for a stroll around the monastery.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>There’s so much to do and never enough time in which to do it. Sleep is a nuisance, but my body forces me to slow down, even though my mind doesn’t want to. Do you have any tips for shaking tired feelings away?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Sleeping when you’re tired is best for you.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I don’t care about being pretty or anything, but it bothers me that some people don’t even realize I’m a girl.</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>They’re wrong, pay them no mind</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I hate cleaning my room.

But if I go to class after a big meal, I can’t help getting sleepy…</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Bring along a snack, just in case.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>You know how sometimes an ordinary girl can be more popular than an exceptional beauty? Or how, with aristocrats, some prefer a viscount when they could have a duke instead? Why do you think that is?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Fancy meals are boring if you eat them every day.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I enjoy a good ghost story, but I’ve never seen a ghost in real life. I would love to have that experience for myself, even just once!</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Maybe you need a ritual to summon one.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>When one professor lectures many students, some will inevitably have trouble keeping up, while others will get too far ahead in their studies. I wonder how this problem might be solved…</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Perhaps we should make lectures optional</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Such interesting ideas you seem to have, Professor, but tell me this: what would you do if you were given the task of teaching a subject than you yourself did not understand?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I’d take the time to study the subject before teaching it.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Pretty soon I’ll have eaten everything they have to offer in the dining hall. Then what am I supposed to do? Keep eating the same boring meals over and over again?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>You should just enjoy` what you’ve got</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I want to be able to talk to males and make friends with them, but my brother always causes such a fuss when I do. Do you have any advice for me?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Do it when he’s not looking.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Magic is not my forte. Being a gifted swordsman, I think my time is best served practicing swordplay technique. Why should I waste my time attending lectures, just to improve my magic skills from mediocre to average?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Knowing magic will make you a stronger swordsman.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I am an avid arms collector. Since coming to live here, however, I have had much more trouble finding new items for my collection. Any ideas as to where I might find some uncommon weapons?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Ask a blacksmith to teach you how to craft your own.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>When I take a lecture I’m not interested in, I get so…sleepy. I just can’t fight it. I should just give up, don’t you think? Close my eyes and enjoy a peaceful slumber?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>No need to fight it. You can’t help it.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I am having a question. I wish for improvement of my lance skills. But I am having uncertainty about how to be training effectively. What should I be doing?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Try studying the movements of others for improvement.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I’m…kind of terrified to walk the monastery grounds at night. It’s unnerving how dark and quiet the place gets! How can I conquer my fear?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Think of it as training for night marches.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Art has never been my forte. Even when I apply myself and sketch a ton, I don’t seem to improve much. I can envision an image so perfectly in head, but turning it into something physical that I feel good about eludes me…</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Don’t worry about the end result. Just keep practicing.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Though I have served His Highness for four years, he has eluded my every attempt to learn his favorite foods.</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Maybe he just likes everything.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>No matter the weapon, it cannot be wielded properly without ample strength and stamina, regardless of the skills one may possess. I’ve been using various training techniques, but lately I feel like they all are lacking…</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Try focusing on one skill at a time, at least for a while.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Um, excuse me… Can you help me? I always get the feeling that I’m being watched. I get so nervous that I can’t sleep at night…</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>You might be right. You should be careful.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>When I ask them to take part in my experiments, even the most industrious students run away from me. No matter how sincerely I plead! Do you have any suggestions?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Make the “Experiment” a “job” and pay them handsomely.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Some people hate spiders or centipedes, but they have no strong feelings towards flies or crickets. Why is that?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>They may all be bugs, but they’re such different species.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Hey. Maybe you can answer a question I’ve had for a while now… Why is it that men don’t like women who are messy?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Men have unrealistic expectations</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>One of your students keeps challenging me to fight him, but he has no idea how to wield a sword. It’s a waste of time for both of us. What am I supposed to do?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Drop a hint that he needs a new training partner.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I’m real happy here, but there’s somebody who has up and decided to take pity on me. Without asking! It’s real darn irritating, and I want them to know it. I just don’t know how I can make myself understood.</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Show them how happy you are working here.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I’ve been trying to win the heart of this girl, but none of the fancy gifts or weet things I tell her have worked.

It’s SO exhausting, I wish he’d back off and let me live my life. What do you think I should do?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Yammer back at him! See how he likes it!</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I prefer to use stealth tactics to assassinate my foes on the battlefield, but you take a different approach. Why is that?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Those tactics don’t give the enemy a chance to surrender.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>The anniversary of Jeralt’s death is coming up. I’d like to put something on his grave, so that he knows we’re all thinking of him. What item would make him happiest?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>The best bottle of booze you can find.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>As I am fighting more, my arrows are decreasing in quality. They are not flying as far and have less accuracy.

But everyone else seems to think Almyra is so completely different. Why’s that?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>It’s prejudice towards unknown places, nothing more.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Those from northern Faerghus are used to the frigid cold. Although Garreg Mach is located atop a mountain, the summer heat can be quite unbearable for soldiers from the north. What can I do to boost their morale?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Cooling off in a nearby river is always a good option.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Songs are so powerless, Professor. No matter how much one sings, there’s no soldier on the battlefield who will listen. It’s horrible that one can only sing of peace in times of peace.</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>If we can achieve peace, those songs won’t be powerless.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I sometimes find books written in languages I’ve never seen before. I’d love to read them somehow, but I don’t even know where to start… Do you have any ideas?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Piece things together using linguistic clues.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I want to knit an animal doll for someone, but I’m not sure what kind to make.

Let’s say you’re leading an army and the enemy, whose forces greatly outnumber your own, has you surrounded. What would you do in that situation?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Push forward. Punch a hold in their formation.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Just thinking about how, even now, someone out there is fighting for something, I just can’t seem to sit still, even during my breaks.

Not only soldiers, but also warhorses, who have no say in their line of work, lay down their lives on the battlefield. What steps can a commander take to minimize this loss of life?</span><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Adopt new tactics that increase survivability.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>I heard rumors about ghosts roaming the monastery….
