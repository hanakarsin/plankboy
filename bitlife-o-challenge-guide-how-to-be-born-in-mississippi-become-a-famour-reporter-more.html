There are a few other steps along the way, such as giving away several cars and houses, but the hardest part is surprisingly being born as a female in Mississippi since birth is not something that you have a lot of control over in comparison to your career path and other things later in life. Here’s what you need to do in order to complete the O Challenge in BitLife.</p><h2>How to Complete the O Challenge in BitLife</h2><p>There are five steps to completing the O Challenge and each of them is listed below.</p><li>Be a female born in Mississippi.</li><li>Major in journalism while on scholarship.</li><li>Become a famous reporter.</li><li>Give away 10+ cars and 5+ houses.</li><li>Write a best-selling book.</li><p>Keep reading on for more details on each step.</p><img title="BitLife O Challenge Guide: How to Be Born in Mississippi, Become a Famous Reporter, & More" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bitlife-O-Challenge-Tasks.jpg alt=Bitlife-O-Challenge-Tasks width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>How to Be a Female Born in Mississippi</h3><p>The first step of the O Challenge in BitLife is being born as a female in Mississippi. To do so, all you have to do is choose to be born in the city of Biloxi in the theUnited States. This is a city in Mississippi, but the game doesn’t tell you which state each starting city is located in. As long as you choose a female character and select Biloxi as your starting city, you’ll complete this step.</p><h3>How to Major in Journalism While on a Scholarship</h3><p>The next step is to major in journalism on a scholarship. To do so, age up until you reach 18 years old while keeping your character’s Smarts stat as high as possible. Then, enroll at a college and choose journalism as your major. If your Smarts stat is high enough and you focused on academics before graduating high school, then you should be offered a scholarship when you apply for university.</p><h3>How to Become a Famous Reporter</h3><p>After graduating from college with a degree in journalism, it’s time to start a career as a reporter. The career option may not be immediately available, so age up if you don’t see it in the list of potential jobs. You’ll have to start out as a junior reporter, but you will be able to work your way up the corporate ladder to eventually become a famous reporter.</p><h3>How to Give Away 10+ Cars and 5+ Houses</h3><p>Once you’ve become a famous reporter, the fourth step requires you to give away multiple cars and houses. The value of these items doesn’t matter for this challenge, so you can be a cheapskate and give away the least expensive vehicles and homes to people. You can give things away to anyone in the Relationship tab, such as friends or family. This is an expensive challenge, so you’ll need to save most of the money that you make as a reporter.</p><h3>How to Write a Best-Selling Book</h3><p>To close out the O Challenge in BitLife, you need to write a book and have it become a best-seller. You will unlock the Fame section for Activities once you become a famous reporter, and one of the new activities in this section is writing a book. Keep writing books and eventually one of them will become a best-selling title.</p><p>That’s the final step for the O Challenge! BitLife is one of the most popular free mobile games out there, but there are plenty of other options available on the App Store and Google Play Store. <a href=#>Marvel Snap</a> is coming up soon along with <a href=#>Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and <a href=#>Apex Legends Mobile</a> and <a href=#>COD Mobile</a> are both going strong as well.</p><p><strong>BitLife&nbsp;</strong>is available now on mobile devices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZpuhpKG2p7GMqGScoJGhuaa6xp5koK2ZmbJutM6wZK2nXZeybq7Oq6VmoZ5iuqq%2F0qKqrKGgpbZursScpqadXZZ6p63MqKyrZaKavbC%2B056pZqWfp7Jw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbitlife-o-challenge-guide-how-to-be-born-in-mississippi-become-a-famour-reporter-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbitlife-o-challenge-guide-how-to-be-born-in-mississippi-become-a-famour-reporter-more.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbitlife-o-challenge-guide-how-to-be-born-in-mississippi-become-a-famour-reporter-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbitlife-o-challenge-guide-how-to-be-born-in-mississippi-become-a-famour-reporter-more.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbitlife-o-challenge-guide-how-to-be-born-in-mississippi-become-a-famour-reporter-more.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbitlife-o-challenge-guide-how-to-be-born-in-mississippi-become-a-famour-reporter-more.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/blue-lock-chapter-243-release-date-time-and-chapter-242-spoilers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/blue-lock-chapter-243-release-date-time-and-chapter-242-spoilers.html>Blue Lock Chapter 243: Release Date, Time, and Chapter 242 Spoilers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/best-tuning-settings-for-drift-hunters.html>Best Tuning Settings for Drift Hunters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/best-tuning-settings-for-drift-hunters.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
