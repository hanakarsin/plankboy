<time>04 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=565 data-injectable=true data-video=true>We all know what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a> is: it’s our favorite FPS adventure game that features a live story, lots of loot, and space fashion. Lightfall is the latest chapter that spotlights a new campaign, new destination, and new subclass, and has been hyped up for about half a year. Along with the standard expansion elements, Destiny 2 Lightfall marks the launch of changes to Buildcrafting, mods, Weapon Crafting, the difficulty of combatants and activities, and the world economy, while also introducing Loadouts, Guardian Ranks, and Commendations. Bungie’s been busy.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=787 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Though the numerous improvements Bungie has brought forward with Destiny 2 Lightfall are either solid first drafts or nearly perfect, the story of Lightfall, which is the second to last expansion in the Light and Dark Saga, leaves a bit to be desired. Instead of that uncontrollable excitement of climbing higher and higher on a rollercoaster just before the big drop (aka, the next expansion), The Final Shape, the story of Lightfall feels more like setting the table. There’s nothing too grand about it — it’s actually quite repetitive and most likely not the chore you would’ve picked — but the meal that awaits requires preparation and anticipation. Sure, you can snack on some hors d’oeuvres while the table is prepared, but ultimately, you’re left feeling hungry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Destiny-2-Is-Lightfall-the-End.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Beginning of the End – The Lightfall Campaign and Neomuna</h2><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>Coming from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witch Queen</a>, which featured one of the best stories told in Destiny 2 so far, Lightfall has a lot to live up to. Along with that pressure, The Traveler is acting strangely at the end of Season of the Seraph, Raputin’s last message points toward The Veil (I would tell you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what The Veil is</a>, but honestly, we still don’t know) which is hidden on Neptune, and The Witness, the final “big bad” of the Light and Dark Saga, knocks at our front door. With so much at stake, all the responsibility falls on Lightfall’s campaign to give us a satisfying story that sets up the end.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Destiny-2-Lightfall-Neomuna-Strand.jpg><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=843 data-injectable=true>And instead, Destiny 2 Lightfall’s campaign focuses on Calus and his Shadow Legion, Neomuna and its inhabitants, and Strand, the new subclass. Nothing much about The Traveler. Nothing much about The Witness. Nothing much about The Veil. Granted, Lightfall tells its story well, but the penultimate story that we as Destiny 2 players needed in order to understand what’s happening — to build our excitement for the finale — isn’t told in Lightfall. Lightfall tells a really good story, it’s just that it’s the wrong story.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Some May Think Destiny 2 Lightfall’s Campaign May Suck — But Neomuna Certainly Doesn’t</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Lights, Camera, 80’s Montage – The Missions and Pacing</h3><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>In Lightfall, we get a neon-soaked setting and story that go hand-in-hand. As we race Calus, who is an old enemy turned disciple to The Witness, to The Veil hidden in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Neomuna</a>, we discover a curious fabric that we inevitably gain control over called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Strand</a>. We also assist and are assisted by the Cloud Striders, Rohan and Nimbus, who feel a little rushed and forced, but are well-voiced characters that don’t add or take away too much from the Lightfall story.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=631 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>As much as I would rather have a more important and revelatory narrative, the race to The Veil is epic — the missions in Lightfall are some of Bungie’s best-paced and best-executed yet. The objective always feels fresh and important, the environments constantly offer something new, and the weapons and armor look and feel great. The writing found specifically in the payoffs throughout the story is pretty pandering and lifeless, but what’s presented in the missions feels tight and fun. Bungie said we would get an 80s-inspired action movie and Lightfall definitely has a few memorable missions that capture that magic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Destiny-2-Lightfall-The-Witness.jpg><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=809 data-injectable=true>Secrets help create a sense of community as fans are left to speculate what’s next, but in Destiny 2 Lightfall, the major events feel unsatisfying since they are too shrouded in mystery. Mystery is a useful tool in storytelling, but there are a handful of major events that happen in Lightfall’s campaign that are left unexplained and uninvestigated. Building hype and tension for future final reveals is fine, but keeping every player in the dark in the current expansion they paid for crosses the line.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>The end of the Lightfall campaign leaves many more questions than answers. In fact, I’m now nervous to play the next expansion. Instead of unfolding the plot, Bungie might decide to focus on something else entirely. The live nature of Destiny 2’s storytelling can be used effectively to give us breadcrumbs leading to the bigger moments, but Lightfall is that bigger moment, and what we got feels like leftovers.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Lightfall errors in focusing too heavily on Calus, Strand, and the Cloud Striders instead of giving us the exposition needed to understand the big threats and big reveals. That said, the story Lightfall does choose to tell is confident, featuring well-executed missions that are enjoyable, fun, and individually diverse. Compared to The Witch Queen, Lightfall takes the cake for mission design and pacing, which is saying a lot, and hopefully, the mysteries of Lightfall become unraveled in the four Year 6 seasons.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2 Lightfall’s Campaign May Be Disappointing, But Answers Are Coming in the New Seasons, Bungie Confirms</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Destiny-2-Lightfall-Missions.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Neomuna Is the Main Course – The Setting and Tormentors</h3><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Neomuna is an absolutely breathtaking destination. The second you land in the war-torn space city, waving lines of green tug at your curiosity. Sparking purple sands slice the scenery. The Cloud Striders and CloudArc peak your interest in Neomuna’s culture, the architecture, designs, and colors continuously draw you in, and the invasion of Calus’s Shadow Legion brings a palpable suspense.</p><p data-characters=640 data-current-count=1039 data-injectable=true>While Calus’s Shadow Legion is scary and provides a challenge, the real threat comes from the Tormentors, the new enemy type introduced in Lightfall. Tormentors are servants of The Witness that feature terrifying strength. Even on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">normal difficulty</a>, a Tormentor can mess you up if you aren’t careful, which adds a layer of caution and fun similar to the effect of Hunters in Halo. Plus, Tormentors’ dark character design and alien sound effects are bone-chilling. The atmosphere on the battlefield completely shifts when a Tormentor arrives because you know you need to use your abilities, weapons, and mobility carefully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Destiny-2-Lightfall-Neomuna-City.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Down, But Not Out – The Difficulty and Mod Changes</h2><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>With Lightfall, Bungie decided to increase the difficulty of Destiny 2 in numerous ways. While some of their choices are excellent decisions, like changing how to defeat Champion enemies from using specific weapons to using specific subclasses and implementing Surges and Overcharged Weapons in harder activities, where difficulty didn’t need to be added is the subclass abilities.</p><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent Lightfall patch notes</a>, you’ll see that almost every Grenade, Melee, and Super for every subclass and class received an increased cooldown time. While this was done to create more balance and difficulty in Destiny 2, it ultimately makes everything feel less fun. Using your abilities in coordination with your firepower and selecting the best Exotics and Mods to go with your build was one of the best parts of Destiny 2, and all of that got nerfed with Lightfall with increased ability cooldowns. Luckily, Destiny 2 is a live game, meaning nothing is permanent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Destiny-2-Lightfall-Tron-Mission.jpg><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>Speaking of Mods, the Buildcrafting Mod system is much more streamlined and organized, but the Mod selections aren’t exciting. Hopefully, we get more Mods to play with in the future, but currently, there are far fewer unique Mods than ever before which is great for new players but terribly dull for long-time theorycrafters.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=76 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2 Strand: The Best Builds for Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Weave Through Reality – Strand and Quality of Life Improvements</h2><p data-characters=636 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>As for all of the other changes, Destiny 2 is much better thanks to the quality of life changes in Lightfall. We finally have in-game Loadout slots which allow you to save your entire build, we have a Mod overview page that allows for easy viewing and selection, and there are now Guardian Ranks which serve as a new player guide as well as an end game symbol of status. Lightfall also introduces easier weapon crafting (goodbye grinding for red border patterns) and a more consistent way to get Shaders. Overall, the seemingly small quality of life improvements makes a big difference. Also, I can’t wait for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fireteam Finder</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Destiny-2-Best-Warlock-Lightfall-Builds.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>Last, but certainly not least, is Strand. Strand is easily the most fun subclass so far in Destiny 2 thanks to the Grapple, gorgeous animations, and wicked sound designs. Each class harnesses Strand in a unique way: Warlocks summon Threadling minions, Hunters weave rope darts, and Titans slice through the fabric of spacetime. All of the abilities feel great, but what doesn’t feel great is the cooldowns.</p><p data-characters=861 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>I know, I know, I already complained about the ability cooldowns, but Strand is different. Since Strand is unlocked at the end of the Lightfall campaign, you’ll receive windows of time where you get to test drive the subclass during the missions. During these Strand trials, you feel like the most powerful being to ever exist thanks to the cooldowns of your Strand Super, Grenade, Melee, and Class Ability being reduced to mere seconds. This gets you excited to fully unlock Strand, but when you finally do, you’re hit with the reality that even with 100 Discipline, the soonest the Strand Grapple will be available takes one whole minute. Hopefully, Bungie can tweak Strand to make it more enjoyable while also maintaining balance, and maybe, after the grind, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Strand Fragments</a> will help out, but currently, Strand feels a little underwhelming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Destiny-2-Lightfall-Title-Screen.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Verdict</h2><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=true>Destiny 2 is one of the best live service games available and with the positive improvements in Lightfall, Destiny 2 is the best it’s ever been and is on track to continue getting even better. That said, the Lightfall expansion’s story brings nuanced disappointment that’s blood-pumping at best and frustratingly puzzling at worst. On the flip side, Strand is genuinely fun even if it needs a few tweaks and Guardian Ranks, Loadouts, Buildcrafting changes, and Weapon Crafting changes all hover around fantastic.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=false>Perhaps the hype and expectations for Destiny 2 Lightfall were too high, perhaps we should expect more from Bungie’s storytelling. Regardless, Lightfall is enjoyable and Destiny 2 is better for it. Neomuna rocks, the campaign doesn’t suck like people say it does, and Bungie will continue to tweak our favorite space shooter until equilibrium is found. The table is set. Now, all we have to do is wait a year for The Final Shape which is when we can, fingers crossed, finally devour the meal.</p><p>8</p><p>Destiny 2 Lightfall successfully expands upon and upgrades an already fantastic game. With Neomuna, Strand, and the numerous quality of life additions, the only big area Lightfall falters is the story. And while Lightfall's missions are really fun and well-designed, writing excluded, the overall story's biggest problems are its lack of exposition and the fact that it's just the wrong story.</p><p>Reviewed on PlayStation 5</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
