Fans can be excited for additional dubs released the same day for Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 4 in Spanish, Portuguese, and German dubs. More updates to follow once official communication has been released about the Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 3 English dub release time by official parties, so stay tuned!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 4 Trailer</h2><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false>Here is the official trailer for Attack on Titan the Final Season Part 4:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false><p></p></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>The newest 30-second trailer for Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 4 highlights Mikasa and Armin’s attempt to stop Eren from causing more chaos. The trailer features glimpses of scenes from what seems to be the showdown at Fort Salta, where we left off in the previous special. The most captivating image is of Mikasa, who has wings like an angel. Is this simply symbolism or something more significant?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Attack on Titan Season 4 Episode Count</h2><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>The Attack on Titan Final Season will have two hour-long episodes. The first episode was released on March 3, 2023, while the second part was announced for <strong>Fall 2023 </strong>after the official trailer was dropped. Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 3 adapted Chapters 131-134. There are only five manga chapters left to adapt, which means Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 4 will most likely have ample time to cover these chapters within the hour timeframe again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Closing Thoughts on the AoT Finale</h2><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>I’ve made it no secret that I found the manga to be somewhat lacking when compared to the anime. This isn’t always the case, as series like Berserk and many other manga are brilliant when put to the page, with their anime often falling short. But the cinematic execution of this finale, the music, the fiery voice acting, and the emotional storytelling are burned into my brain for this finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Why-Did-Mikasa-Kill-Eren-in-Attack-on-Titan.jpg><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>From Eren’s harrowing lament within his causality loop about how he will never get to truly be with Mikasa, to Levi’s powerful emotional tribute to his fallen comrades as their visages faded, the anime felt superior here. So many of these scenes were in the manga, but with cases like Mikasa’s ghoulish kiss sending Eren off into the afterlife, it feels perfunctory when seeing it in the manga. The movie-length finale was stirring, and deeply sad.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Closing Thoughts on the Attack on Titan Anime</h2><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>This feels like the end of an era, closing the book on the era that got me back into anime as a fan. Attack on Titan was initially animated by WIT Studio, and then by MAPPA, two anime studios renowned for their exceptional quality. The series continued to blow my mind when put on the screen. However, it was in the years between Seasons 1 and 2 of the anime that I initially lost interest in the series, and my passion for the medium began to fade once more.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>However, it had a hell of a comeback as the series progressed toward its epic conclusion, it’s been flanked by brilliant releases seemingly every year. Anime has come a long way even in the past decade, where countless new series are seen as potentially “the next big thing” and we have Attack on Titan to thank. I’ve since latched onto tons of new series and will likely never let go as the medium has claimed me as a lifelong fanboy.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Fans can look forward to other brilliant series from other studios like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oshi no Ko</a>, Vinland Saga, and more. But the anime that put the medium arguably into its strongest position as a mainstream fandom was Attack on Titan, and we should never forget its legacy of quality and its fervent fanbase that kept it alive and thriving for a decade.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
