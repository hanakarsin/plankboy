This build earns its position on our list thanks to its ability to deal massive amounts of Geo damage.&nbsp;If you don’t have access to Gorou at C4, using <a href=#>Noelle</a> in Zhongli’s place can work really well. Noelle can also replace Itto and excel as the main DPS when on C6 and paired up with<a href=#> Yun Jin</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>9 – Xiao + Bennett (C1+) + Jean/Venti + Zhongli</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/xiao-best-team.jpg alt=xiao-best-team width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Xiao</a> may no longer be considered one of the game’s top 5 DPS’, but his ability to deal massive Burst damage at low intervals, as well as his great synergy with <a href=#>Bennett</a> still makes him a great pick for pretty much any scenario. With that said, this composition features the already-mentioned duo, as well as either Venti or Jean as an Anemo battery and Zhongli as the shield support, which will allow you to freely make use of Xiao’s Burst without reservation.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>8 – Tighnari + Bennett (C1+) + Fischl (Ideally C6)/Raiden Shogun + Albedo</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tighnari-best-teams.jpg alt=tighnari-best-teams width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>In eighth place, we have a team focused on powering up <a href=#>Tighnari</a>, Genshin Impact’s latest Dendro 5-star. The team shines thanks to its ability to both increase Tighnari’s overall ATK% through Bennett’s Burst as well as allow him and <a href=#>Fischl</a> to trigger Dendro/Electro reactions often, thus massively boosting their overall damage. Last but not least, Albedo will allow the team to stay shielded, all while also providing both Fischl and Tighnari with a healthy bonus in EM.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>7 – Raiden Shogun + Bennett/Jean + Kazuha + Yae Miko</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Yae-miko-raiden-best-teams.jpg alt=Yae-miko-raiden-best-teams width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=555 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>A composition capable of dealing massive Electro damage. This team earns its spot thanks to its ability to boost the Elemental Bursts of both the Raiden Shogun and <a href=#>Yae Miko</a> in quick rotations, a feat made possible thanks to both the Shogun’s excellence in generating particles and the use of two of the game’s best supports, Bennett and <a href=#>Kaedehara Kazuha. </a>Bennet and Kazuha are our picks thanks to the fact that the former is capable of massively boosting ATK, while the latter has his ability to boost Elemental Damage as his biggest strength.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>Using a variation featuring the Raiden Shogun, the<a href=#> Dendro Traveler</a>, Jean, and then Yae Miko can also work well, thanks to the proprieties of Quicken.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>6 – Yoimiya + Yelan + Xingqiu + Yun Jin</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Genshin-yoimiya-best-teams.jpg alt=Genshin-yoimiya-best-teams width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Currently the best overall team for <a href=#>Yoimiya</a>, this team shines thanks to its ability to allow her to trigger Vaporize as much as possible, while also providing small amounts of healing, dealing high amounts of off-the-field damage, and both buffing her normal attacks and providing Sheilds at quick intervals. Using a variation of the team featuring either Albedo or Zhongli in Yun Jin’s place can also work well.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>5 – Eula + Diona + Rosaria + Fischl/Raiden Shogun</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Eula-best-teams-genshin.jpg alt=Eula-best-teams-genshin width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>The game’s best Physical team, this composition is focused on empowering Eula’s already high damage ceiling by providing large amounts of energy through Diona, increasing her CRIT Rate through Rosaria, and keeping enemies almost permanently affected by the debuffs of the Superconduct reaction through Fischl, who will also work as a secondary DPS and offer the team with massive amounts of Energy. Using the Raiden Shogun in Fischl’s place can also work extremely well.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>The team also massively increases Eula’s survivability thanks to Diona’s ability to both shield her and heal efficiently. For those who don’t have Eula, using Razor can also work well, as the Cryo units will allow you to trigger Superconduct and Fischl will work as a top-tier battery.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>4 – Ayaka / Ganyu + Kokomi/Yelan + Kazuha + Shenhe/Diona</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ayaka-best-teams.jpg alt=ayaka-best-teams width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>A composition fully focused on perma-freezing your enemies and allowing <a href=#>Kamisato Ayaka</a> to make full use of her set as well as the effects of the Blizzard Strayer artifact set, mainly through the use of <a href=#>Sangonomiya Kokomi</a>‘s Hydro application potential. This assemble is considered by many as the best Cryo-focused composition in the game, thanks to <a href=#>Shenhe</a> and Kazuha’s potential to massively boost Ayaka’s damage input.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>This team can also shine when featuring <a href=#>Ganyu</a> as its main DPS, thanks to her ability to deal massive damage at low intervals while also beneficiating from the Cryo buffs.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>3 – Tartaglia (Childe) + Bennett + Kazuha + Xiangling</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tartaglia-childe-best-teams.jpg alt=tartaglia-childe-best-teams width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>The game’s best team featuring a Hydro main DPS, this composition is focused on allowing Tartaglia (Childe) to trigger Vaporize as often as possible by using Bennett and Xiangling, all while also featuring Kazuha as both a buffer and enabler, a role he can perform perfectly thanks to his passive and Elemental Burst.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>2 – Raiden Shogun + Bennett + Xingqiu/Yelan + Xiangling</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Genshin-raiden-shogun-best-teams.jpg alt=Genshin-raiden-shogun-best-teams width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>The Raiden National composition, considered by many as the game’s best, shines thanks to its ability to deal massive damage and empower every single one of its units, all while allowing them to perform their Bursts as often as possible in a quick rotation. Overall, the composition features Raiden as the main DPS, Bannett as the healer as well as the party’s main buffer, Xingqiu as an enabler, and Xiangling as an off-the-field DPS.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>1 – Hu tao + Xingqiu/Yelan + Albedo + Zhongli</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="The 10 Best Teams on Genshin Impact, Ranked (3.0)" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/genshin-best-teams-hutao.jpg alt=genshin-best-teams-hutao width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=674 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Currently the game’s most damaging composition, as well as its best Pyro-focused one. This team shines thanks to its straightforwardness, as well as the fact that unlike many of the teams featured above, it only needs to feature one top-tier support to excel. With that said, this team is focused on allowing <a href=#>Hu Tao</a> to trigger Vaporize as often as possible by using Xingqiu’s Burst, while also keeping her relatively safe at low HP by using Albedo and Zhongli, the former which will also increase Hu Tao’s damage thanks to his EM buff. Albedo and Xingqiu will also work as off-the-field offensive supports, further enhancing the team’s damage output.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>Using a variation of the team, featuring Yelan in Albedo/Zhongli’s place can also work extremely well, as doing so will further increase your overall damage through her highly damaging Elemental Burst.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Now that you know what are the best teams on Genshin Impact, don’t forget to also check out <a href=#>everything we know about the game’s anime series </a>and <a href=#>how to get all of the rewards available as part of the celebration of the game’s second anniversary</a>.</p><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false><strong>Genshin Impact</strong> is currently available for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
