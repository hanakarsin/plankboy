Some of these creatures, such as <strong>The Dupe</strong>, are rather tricky in the way that they catch the player off guard without a moment’s notice.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>However, gamers can depend on us to deliver the most complete compendium of <strong>Entity entries</strong> around, as well as tips and tricks on how to avoid these things that go bump in the night. Let’s grab a flashlight, and see if we can’t ensure a victory, rather than a defeat on the next run of <strong>DOORS</strong>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>All Entities And Ways To Survive Them in DOORS</h2><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>With a fair number of creatures and spirits roaming these cursed halls, players may need to find out how to avoid the terrifying creatures in this <strong>Roblox</strong> experience. Let’s go into detail about what players may need to avoid, and the best ways to do just that.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity #1: Figure</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Figure-Doors-Roblox.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Players that have made their way into <strong>Rooms 50 & 100</strong> have had the horrifying experience of running into <strong>Figure</strong>, one of the most haunting creatures that roam the halls of <strong>DOORS</strong>. However, while they may be terrifying to view, there is a special trick that players can utilize to avoid meeting their untimely doom.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false><strong>Figure</strong> is completely <strong>blind</strong>, so while the first thing players may want to do when they see this creature is run away, or try to get by it as fast as possible, <strong>crouching </strong>as low to the floor as possible and walking by as slowly as possible can ensure that players will live to see another day.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity #2: Rush</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Rush-Doors-Roblox.jpg><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false><strong>Rush</strong> is a speed demon, and can take the player out quickly if they aren’t paying attention to their surroundings. The first way that players can ensure Rush is on its way is if the lights begin to flicker in the room they have just entered. What can players do to avoid this particular creature, however?</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Jump into the closest <strong>Wardrobe</strong> and wait for what sounds like an <strong>approaching train</strong>. Players will see something zoom past their small field of view quickly, meaning that <strong>Rush</strong> has finally gotten past them. After emerging, players will notice that the room has gone entirely dark, and the way to exit has been opened.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity #3: Ambush</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ambush-DOORS-Roblox.jpg><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true><strong>Ambush</strong> is the much more aggressive, older brother of the previous entry, <strong>Rush</strong>. While players get a fair amount of time to react to <strong>Rush</strong>, <strong>Ambush</strong> will fly into the room and take out a player without much notice, meaning that gamers will need to pay much more attention to their run during the latter half of their adventure.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Much like <strong>Rush</strong>, players will need to find a <strong>Cupboard</strong> as quickly as possible. However, what makes this spirit harder to avoid is the fact that it can <strong>follow a player</strong> if they are not careful, even coming into new rooms with them. Players should avoid <strong>Cupboards</strong> that are facing doors, and keep out of their line of sight. Players will know that they’ve avoided <strong>Ambush</strong> rather than <strong>Rush</strong> if the door to the new room does <strong>not open</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity #4: Seek</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Seek-Roblox-DOORS.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Those hoping for a stress-free run will not enjoy their first encounter with <strong>Seek</strong>. Players will know if <strong>Seek</strong> is around the corner if they begin seeing <strong>eyes</strong> popping up in the rooms that they are visiting. While players may encounter <strong>Seek</strong> two different times in their run, the encounters will play out very similarly.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>As its name suggests, <strong>Seek</strong> will run after players quite rapidly, and gamers will need to be quick to react when it comes to this particular demon. Thankfully, its appearance is known right away, as a <strong>cutscene </strong>will trigger when this spirit has come forth. Players will just need to follow the <strong>Guiding Light</strong> in the chase to avoid getting caught by <strong>Seek</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity #5: Halt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Halt-Roblox-DOORS.jpg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false><strong>Halt</strong> is one of the most terrifying on the list because their entrance is incredibly jarring to the player. When entering a new room, <strong>DOORS</strong> fans may notice that lights begin flashing rapidly, and for much longer than normal. This means that <strong>Halt</strong> is waiting for them in the next room, but thankfully, you’ve come prepared.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>If players begin to see the text <strong>Turn Around</strong> or <strong>Run Away</strong> appear on the screen, they’ll simply need to <strong>walk backward</strong> to avoid this monster. While it may be terrifying to look them straight in the face while doing so, it makes the trek through this hallway much easier to accomplish. Players simply need to make their way to the end before they can continue their run.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity #6: Eyes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Eyes-Roblox-DOORS.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Easily one of the most <strong>eye-conic</strong> entities on this list, <strong>Eyes</strong> is also one of the easiest to avoid in the grand scheme of things. While their appearance may be sudden, those with nerves of steel and the speed to avoid their gaze will find these rooms to be quite easy.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>All players will need to do once they encounter a room with <strong>Eyes</strong> inside is <strong>look away</strong> and hug the walls to escape through to the next room. That’s really all there is to it. Avoid looking into the <strong>Eyes</strong>, and escape through into the next room to survive another day in this haunted hotel.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity # 7: Screech</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screech-DOORS-Roblox.jpg><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>If players find themselves stuck in a dark room without a light source, there is a good chance that they’ll get a visit from <strong>Screech</strong> sooner than later. This entity likes to hide out in the corners of the darkest depths of the <strong>Rooms</strong> players visit, and if they don’t have a <strong>candle, lighter, or flashlight</strong>, they will see this creature soon.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=809 data-injectable=true>The easiest way to avoid <strong>Screech</strong> is to either <strong>purchase a flashlight</strong> before their run to ensure they have a <strong>light source</strong>, or find a <strong>lighter or candle</strong> before progressing too far into the world of <strong>DOORS</strong>. Finding the exit quickly is key, and once in a new room, players will want to make sure that they check behind them to see if <strong>Screech</strong> has followed them into the new location. If players find it, they can avoid taking damage, rather than <strong>Screech</strong> finding them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Entity #8: The Dupe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Survive-The-Dupe-Roblox.jpg><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true><strong>The Dupe</strong> is one of the newest creatures added to <strong>DOORS</strong> and can be one of the easiest to lose track of. As its name suggests, <strong>The Dupe</strong> will trick players into entering a <strong>duplicate door</strong>, where it will quickly cause damage to the player. However, there is a simple trick to avoiding this creature.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Players will need to pay attention to the <strong>room number</strong> of the door that they have entered. As players continue through their adventure, they may find themselves in <strong>Room 28</strong>, for example. When exploring, there will be another <strong>Room 28</strong> door, as well as a <strong>Room 29</strong> door. <strong>The Dupe</strong> will be hiding behind the second <strong>Room 28</strong> door. If you are struggling with this <strong>entity</strong>, we’ve got you covered on <strong><a href=#>how to survive</a></strong> against them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Lesser Entities In DOORS</h3><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>There are a few other entities that are in this title, and the majority of them pose no harm to the player. As groups or solo players make their way through the Halls, they may encounter these souls:</p><ul data-found-items=6 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true><li><strong>Hide</strong><ul><li>Located inside of <strong>Cupboards</strong>, it will push the player out if they stay in one for too long</li></ul></li><li><strong>Jack</strong><ul><li>A quick jumpscare to freak the player out, will not cause damage</li></ul></li><li><strong>Glitch</strong><ul><li>Will appear to push players into a new room if an error occurs, non-hostile</li></ul></li><li><strong>Timothy</strong><ul><li>A small spider, which can cause minor damage, found inside drawers at random points</li></ul></li><li><strong>Shadow</strong><ul><li>The rarest entity, it will cause a jump scare but no damage</li></ul></li><li><strong>Window</strong><ul><li>A malicious grin that will occasionally appear in the windows of a room, non-hostile</li></ul></li></ul><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>As players continue navigating through these terrifying halls, they can only anticipate what will be added next. It seems the developers are ready to throw some more scares our way, and we are all here for it. Let’s make the next run through <strong>DOORS</strong> the best yet, and be sure to grab a light before heading on into this terrifying experience.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=false><strong>Roblox</strong> is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Mobile Devices, and PC.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
