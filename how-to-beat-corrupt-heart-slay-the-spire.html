<time>15 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Oh, I’m sorry to hear you died to The Heart on turn three again. It literally happens to even the best Slay the Spire players. I’ve died to it multiple times even with decks that simply demolished the Act 3 bosses.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>Beating The Heart – or should I say stop its beating? – requires a combination of good deck building, chasing relics, stocking the right potions, and your best decision making. The Heart’s attacks and skills are so brutal you need to prepare yourself to fight it as early in your run as possible, sometimes taking cards and saving potions that you otherwise would not.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>To destroy The Heart, you must learn how it destroys you. As some Slay the Spire players say, you need to understand how to solve The Heart, which means dealing with whatever threats it throws at you.</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>All following information is applicable to any level of play, including Ascension 20.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Summary</h2><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>If you feel confident about your Slay the Spire knowledge, feel free to click any of the links below to move to the section that will serve you best. Otherwise, scroll down for the full ride.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-lose data-injectable=false>How The Heart beats you in Slay the Spire</h2><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>The Heart is a juggernaut with 750 health points up to Ascension 8 and 800 from Ascension 9 onwards. It has the following powers to make your attempt painful:</p><figure class=wp-block-table data-found-rows=3 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true><table><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td><strong>Power</strong></td><td><strong>Effect</strong></td><td><strong><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 1 energy. Gain Block equal to the number of cards in your discard pile (+3).">Stack</span>s&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Beat of Death</td><td>Whenever you play a card, take X damage.</td><td>Take 1 damage up to Ascension 18<br>Take 2 damage on Ascension 19 or higher.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Invincible</td><td>Caps all damage and HP loss taken to X each turn.</td><td>300 up to Ascension 18<br>200 on Ascension 19 or higher</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>The powers alone are enough to kill you, and it’s part of the initiation to Slay the Spire to die at least once to Beat of Death because you forgot to block. Not that I ever did this.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Also, it’s impossible to one-shot the heart due to Invincible. Up to Ascension 18, it forces you to spend at least three turns to kill it, and in higher ascensions, at least four.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>The Heart can disintegrate you with the following attack pattern:</p><ul data-found-items=7 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false><li><strong>Turn one</strong>: Applies a debuff to make you take 50% more damage, reduce your attack damage by 25%, and reduce your block gained from cards by 25%, all for two turns (2 Vulnerable, 2 Weak, 2 Frail), in this order. Adds one of each status cards Dazed, Slimed,&nbsp; Wound, Burn, and Void into your draw pile.</li><li><strong>Turns two and three</strong>: Attacks for 40 (45) damage with Echo or 2×12(15) damage with Blood Shots, in either order.</li><li><strong>Turn four</strong>: Buff<ul><li>1st Buff (turn four): Artifact 2</li><li>2nd Buff (turn seven): Beat of Death 1</li><li>3rd Buff (turn 10): Painful Stabs</li><li>4th Buff (turn 13): Strength 10</li><li>5th Buff onward (turn 16, 19, 22[…]): Strength 50</li></ul></li></ul><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>That means you really want to kill The Heart before on turn 17 at most. The 10 strength it gains on turn 13 is already a menace, so killing it before that turn is your best option. I already went beyond that, but my character didn’t live to tell the story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-win data-injectable=false>Beating The Heart in Slay the Spire</h2><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>The main questions The Heart asks you with all its attacks are:</p><li>Do you have enough health or block generation to play cards while taking damage from Beat of Death?</li><li>Can you protect against or get rid of debuffs?</li><li>Can you handle Status cards?</li><li>Can you handle a buffed opponent?</li><li>Can you deal 750(800) damage in 17 turns at most?</li><li>Can you block or resist at least 40(45) damage per turn?</li><li>In a worst-case scenario, can you block or resist up to 240 damage (16×15) if you can’t kill The Heart by turn 14?</li><li>Do you rely on debuffs to kill enemies? If so, can you burn through 2 stacks of Artifact reliably?</li><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Solving most of these questions is your goal when building your deck, when looking for relics, and when saving potions (looking at you all who love to pick <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Boss relic. Gain 1 Energy at the start of each turn. You can no longer obtain potions.">Sozu</span>).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>You don’t need to solve all of them, though. If you can consistently get absurd block numbers like using Barricade and Entretch, you don’t care about Beat of Death damage or even being Frail. The same way, If you can deal massive damage in a few turns, like 100 or more Poison stacks with Silent by turn four, you never have to care about dealing with The Heart’s late-fight buffs or removing its Artifact.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>The Heart always reminds me that I have other questions that I should have answered throughout my run –which will cost me the fight if I didn’t:</p><ul data-found-items=2 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false><li>Can I get the right cards in my hand at the right time (do I have card draw and hand manipulation)</li><li>Do I have enough energy to play my cards (do I have energy generation and scaling)?</li></ul><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>I will not talk about these broader deckbuilding and gameplay concepts since this guide is already long enough. First, I’ll talk about answering the eight main questions with potions, relics, and Colorless cards any character can use. Then, I’ll go over what each character has on their own belt to cut through The Heart.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>All answers consider the worst-case scenario, where you’re on Ascension 19 or higher. If you’re not, these solutions will be even more effective for you since The Heart will be weaker.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=answers data-injectable=false>Answers for The Heart with all Slay the Spire characters</h2><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Let’s break down the answers one by one.</p><li><strong>Do you have enough health or block generation to play cards while taking damage from Beat of Death?</strong></li><p data-characters=57 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>In the Colorless cards set, these are my recommendations:</p><ul data-found-items=4 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Gain 2(4) Block.Draw 1 card.">Finesse</span>+ will give you four block, which makes the card pay for itself and give you block to play another one without losing health. The card draw is also very welcome, especially if you’re going for an infinite combo.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Gain 6(9) Block.">Good Instincts</span> gives you six block for zero energy, enough to play at least two cards without losing health. Not as good as <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Gain 2(4) Block.Draw 1 card.">Finesse</span>+ since you don’t draw, but I’m not sad if I have to use it.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 1 energy. Gain 1 Intangible. Exhaust. Ethereal. (no longer Ethereal.)(Obtained from event: Council of Ghosts).">Apparition</span>’s Intangible reduces the Beat of Death damage to 1, which is also very helpful to take more value out of block cards.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Gain 30(40) Block. You cannot gain Block from cards for the next 2 turns. Exhaust.">Panic Button</span> can work depending on your setup. It’s a lot of block, but ideally you want to have Artifact or debuff cleansing with <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Shop relic. Whenever you play a Power, Attack, and Skill in the same turn, remove all of your Debuffs.">Orange Pellets</span> when using it against The Heart to avoid the block denial debuff.</li></ul><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=56 data-injectable=false>Regarding relics, these can help you solve this problem:</p><ul data-found-items=9 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. Whenever you would lose HP, lose 1 less.">Tungsten Rod</span> is one of the most valuable relics against The Heart. It will reduce Beat of Death’s damage to one (or zero in low Ascensions), but only if you would take health damage. If you’re setting up block, you will still lose two points of it.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Common relic. Start each combat with 10 Block.">Anchor</span>, <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Uncommon relic. At the start of your 2nd turn, gain 14 Block.">Horn Cleat</span>, and Captain’s Wheel all give you block when turns one, two, and three start, respectively. This gives you some buffer to safely use the cards you need to set up.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Common relic. The first time you lose HP each combat, draw 3 cards.">Centennial Puzzle</span> is an indirect solution. Depending on your hand, it might be worth using a card when you have no block just to take damage and trigger this relic for the card draw to get what you need. I love doing so in the early turns.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Common relic. At the start of each combat, gain 1 Dexterity.">Oddly Smooth Stone</span> helps you get more value from direct block cards.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Uncommon relic. Every time you play 3 Attacks in a single turn, gain 4 Block.">Ornamental Fan</span> is a boost for Attack-heavy decks. Getting the four block will pay the cost of playing attacks that don’t generate it.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. At the start of your turn, lose 15 Block rather than all of your Block.">Calipers</span> is great if you can scale and generate a lot of block every turn, like with Panic Button. It can snowball in later turns in block-heavy decks like Defect with Frost orbs, Iron Clad with exhaust cards and Feel no Pain, and Silent with <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Power, 1 energy. Gain 2(3) Dexterity.">Footwork</span>.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. Every 6 turns, gain 1 Intangible.">Incense Burner</span> gives you one stack of Intangible, which will reduce the Beat of Death damage.</li><li>It won’t look pretty, but <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. When you would die, heal to 50% of your Max HP instead (works once).">Lizard Tail</span> in a worst-case scenario can save you from dying to Beat of Death if you really need to play an important card and take that last hit.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Shop relic. Gain 6 Block whenever you shuffle your draw pile.">The Abacus</span>’ six block is nothing to scoff at when it triggers. That’s some free cards you can play after you shuffle your deck, which is especially useful when combined with Defect’s <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Shuffle all of your cards into your draw pile, then draw 4(6) cards. Exhaust.">Reboot</span>.</li></ul><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=29 data-injectable=false>Be careful with these relics:</p><ul data-found-items=3 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. Whenever you would receive 5 or less unblocked Attack damage, reduce it to 1.">Torii</span> just reduces attack damage, and Beat of Death is damage from The Heart’s power, so it won’t trigger this relic. It’s still a great relic against Blood Shots, though.</li><li>While <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Event relic. The first Attack played each turn that costs 2 or more is played twice. When you take this relic, become Cursed.">Necronomicon</span> is a great relic, it triggers Beats of Death a second time when it plays a copy of your attack. Make sure you can spare 4 block or health before activating it.</li><li>You will spend the Buffer from <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. Prevent the first time you would lose HP in combat.">Fossilized Helix</span> if you take Beat of Death damage, which happened to me on turn one more than I would like to admit. If you have this relic, always start the fight with block, or you will miss having it when The Heart attacks you for 45 damage.</li></ul><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>Regarding potions, these are your best options:</p><ul data-found-items=4 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false><li>Block Potion and Skill Potion can be useful if you’re having a setup-heavy turn where you need to save your energy for other cards.</li><li>Dexterity Potion helps, since it increases the value of your block cards.</li><li>Fairy in a Bottle is also a sad look for this case, just like <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. When you would die, heal to 50% of your Max HP instead (works once).">Lizard Tail</span>, but you might be forced to trigger it with Beat of Death in some situations.</li><li>Regen Potion is not ideal either, but it can recover your health if you were forced to spend it instead of blocking.</li></ul><li><strong>Can you protect against or get rid of debuffs?</strong></li><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>The list here is way shorter, so I won’t break it down by category. Here are your options:</p><ul data-found-items=6 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Gain 1(2) Artifact.Exhaust.">Panacea</span> will protect you from being Vulnerable and, if you upgrade it, from Weak too.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Shop relic. At the start of each combat, gain 1 Artifact.">Clockwork Souvenir</span>‘s 1 Artifact is perfect against The Heart. Just check if it’s worth spending it sooner, like denying debuffs from Wraith Form or Biased Cognition.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Shop relic. Whenever you play a Power, Attack, and Skill in the same turn, remove all of your Debuffs.">Orange Pellets</span> is good in diverse decks that can draw consistently on turn two.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. You can no longer become Weakened.">Ginger</span> and <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. You can no longer become Frail.">Turnip</span> make you immune to Weak and Frail, respectively. I love when I get them and essentially deny The Heart’s turn two.</li><li>The <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Event relic. When Vulnerable, take 25% more damage rather than 50%.">Odd Mushroom</span> relic, from the Act 1 event Hypnotizing Colored Mushrooms, halves the strength of Vulnerable on you, making you take 25% more damage instead of 50%. It doesn’t solve the issue, but it helps.</li><li>Ancient Potion also gives you 1 Artifact (or 2 with <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Boss relic. Double the effectiveness of potions.">Sacred Bark</span>). Another great, energy-free and Beat of Death-safe protection against debuffs.</li></ul><li><strong>Can you deal with Status cards?</strong></li><ul data-found-items=4 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true><li>The best way to handle Status cards is <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Shop relic. Status cards can now be played. Playing a Status will Exhaust the card.">Medical Kit</span>, which lets you play Status cards to exhaust them for no energy. If you see this relic late in your run, it’s probably worth buying it.</li><li>Card draw in general can help make up for the loss you have when you draw Status cards. Colorless cards like <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. If you have no Attack cards in your hand, draw 2(3) cards.">Impatience</span>, Master of Strategy, <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Choose an Attack from your draw pile and place it into your hand. Exhaust. (Don't Exhaust)">Secret Weapon</span>, <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Choose a Skill from your draw pile and place it into your hand. Exhaust. (Don't Exhaust)">Secret Technique</span>, and <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Place 3(4) random Attack cards from your draw pile into your hand. Exhaust.">Violence</span> can get some useful cards in your hand despite the Status ones.</li><li>Draw potions Gambler’s Brew and Swift Potion also help you get useful cards in your hand when you draw Status cards.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Choose and Exhaust 3(5) cards in your hand. Exhaust.">Purity</span> is your only Colorless option to exhaust Burn and Wound (and Slime for 0 energy).</li></ul><p data-characters=11 data-current-count=11 data-injectable=false>Be careful!</p><ul data-found-items=1 data-current-count=51 data-injectable=false><li>While <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Boss relic. At the end of your turn, you no longer discard your hand.">Runic Pyramid</span> is an amazing boss relic, it retains Wound and Slime in your hand. If you have this relic, prioritize getting <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Choose and Exhaust 3(5) cards in your hand. Exhaust.">Purity</span> or Medical Kid to not have your hand stuck with Wound, which can only be exhausted by effects. This is especially important if you go for the long Heart fight and The Heart uses Painful Stabs, which could fill your deck and hand with Wounds.</li></ul><li><strong>Can you deal with a buffed opponent?</strong></li><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>There’s no way to clear your enemy’s buffs in Slay the Spire, so the best you can do is either apply debuffs on The Heart or apply stronger and faster buffs on yourself to outscale it. Since you and I will talk about scaling your character in their own section, let’s chat about debuffing the Heart for now.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>The key buff in this case is the Strength that The Heart gains every three turns after turn four.</p><ul data-found-items=4 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false><li>Applying Weak to the Heart is very important. It gets you damage mitigation even if you’re Frail, and due to The Heart’s multi-attacks and high damage, you can protect yourself from damage more efficiently with Weak than with many block cards.<ul><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Apply 2 Weak (to ALL enemies).">Blind</span> is a zero-energy Colorless card that applies 2 Weak for no energy.</li><li>Weak Potion guarantees you 3 Weak on The Heart without depending on card draw</li><li>Event relic <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Event relic. At the start of each combat, apply 1 Weak to ALL enemies.">Red Mask</span> only triggers on turn one, but it can be helpful if you also have a turn-one Weak effect you can stack to extend the duration of the debuff for the attacking rounds.</li></ul></li><li>Reducing its Strength<ul><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Enemy loses 9(15) Strength for the rest of this turn.Exhaust.">Dark Shackles</span> is The Heart’s worst nightmare. This Colorless Card can make even the strongest Blood Shoots deal zero damage thanks to its Strength debuff.</li></ul></li></ul><li><strong>Can you deal 750(800) damage in 17 turns at most?</strong></li><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>I will talk about damage scaling since it’s the best way to reach this level of damage. You need some way to burst The Heart consistently either by buffing your character or debuffing the boss.</p><ul data-found-items=8 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false><li>Applying Vulnerable is a good choice if you’re going for direct damage. The colorless card <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 0 energy. Apply 2 Vulnerable (to ALL enemies).">Trip</span>, the Fear Potion, and the relic <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Common relic. At the start of each combat, apply 1 Vulnerable to ALL enemies.">Bag of Marbles</span> can all help you set it up. <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Shop relic. Whenever you break an enemy's Block, apply 2 Vulnerable.">Hand Drill</span> is useless since The Heart never gains block.</li><li>J.A.X from the Augmenter event in Act 2 is a Strength gain alternative. You might need other supporting cards to help you reuse it and gain substantial values of it, though.</li><li>Non-scaling Strength buffs like Strength Potion, <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Common relic. At the start of each combat, gain 1 Strength.">Vajra</span>, and <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare relic. You can now gain Strength at Rest Sites. (3 times max)">Girya</span> are always welcome, though alone they might not make the cut.</li><li>Flex Potion can help you set up a good burst turn. If you have Artifact and use this potion, you will spend the Artifact to avoid losing -5 Strength at the end of your turn, making you gain permanent +5 Strength for the rest of the fight.</li><li>Cultist Potion is great for this fight. We’re talking about a long run, so you will also gain strength and even outscale The Heart’s strength for a few turns if you use Cultist Potion early.</li><li>Uncommon relic <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Uncommon relic. Every time you play 3 Attacks in a single turn, gain 1 Strength.">Shuriken</span> is a good Strength scaling option. Just be careful with Beat of Death damage, which will make each <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Uncommon relic. Every time you play 3 Attacks in a single turn, gain 1 Strength.">Shuriken</span> activation cost you six block or health.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Common relic. Every 10th Attack you play deals double damage.">Pen Nib</span> is an invaluable relic if you set it up properly before the fight. Doubling the damage of your attacks, especially after your scaling is set up, can make you end the fight faster. Just don’t be like me and forget to check its stacks while battling.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Event relic. The first Attack played each turn that costs 2 or more is played twice. When you take this relic, become Cursed.">Necronomicon</span> is great to take more value out of high-cost attacks like <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Attack, 2 energy. Gain 10(13) Block. Deal 10(13) damage.">Dash</span>, Heavy Blade, <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Attack, 2 energy.

Gain Block equal to unblocked damage dealt.">Wallop</span>.</li></ul><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>In the energy scaling front — since the more energy you have, the more damage you can deal — you also have a few options.</p><ul data-found-items=5 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 1(0) energy. A random card in your hand costs 0 for the rest of combat. Exhaust.">Madness</span> will let you play expensive cards repeatedly, save some energy, or even set up infinite combos.</li><li>Non-boss energy relics that triggers fast and multiple times in one fight, especially those you can control their activation like <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Common relic. If you do not play any Attacks during your turn, gain an extra Energy next turn.">Art of War</span>, <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Uncommon relic.

Use Wrath, use <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Attack, 2 energy. Deal 9(12) damage. Gain Block equal to unblocked damage dealt.">Wallop</span> to deal at least 18 damage, and leave Wrath to retain the heavy block you gained.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 2 energy. Retain. Gain 12(16) Block.">Protect</span> is a decent card to have since it stays in your hand and you can use it in the turn you need it. It’s more impactful with some Dexterity and when upgraded. The same logic applies to <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 1 energy. Retain. Gain 12(16) Block. Exhaust.">Safety</span> you generate from <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 1 energy. Gain 4(7) Block. Add a Safety to your hand.">Deceive Reality</span>.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Power, 2 energy. Gain 3(4) Strength. Gain 3(4) Dexterity. Gain 1 less Energy at the start of each turn.">Fasting</span> can be incredibly useful if you use it when you have Artifact or can cleanse its debuff with <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Shop relic. Whenever you play a Power, Attack, and Skill in the same turn, remove all of your Debuffs.">Orange Pellets</span>. The three dexterity can be just what you need to make survival an easy task.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Power, 1 energy. At the end of your turn, if you are in Calm, gain 5(7) Block.">Like Water</span> is a good power to get you some extra block from defensive turns when in Calm.&nbsp;</li><li>While <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 1 energy. Retain. Gain 5(7) Block. Whenever this card is Retained, increase its Block by 2(3).">Perseverance</span> may look like a good big block card, it won’t make it alone. The Heart outscales it quite fast. By turn 14, the most it can do is block for 46 at zero Dexterity while The Heart can be hitting you for 240 with Blood Shots.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 2 energy. Gain 3(4) Block for each card in your hand.">Spirit Shield</span> can be great when used with big draw cards, letting you block for a maximum of 27 unupgraded.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Uncommon (Watcher only) relic. Whenever you play an Attack, gain 1 temporary Dexterity.">Duality</span> is a funny relic to use against The Heart. It gives you Dexterity when you use an Attack, which means you’re taking Beat of Death damage to recover that block in the future. It’s useful, but not essential.</li><li><span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Rare (Watcher only) relic. At the end of your turn, gain 1 Block for each card in your hand.">Cloak Clasp</span> relic may be a cheap block sometimes, but any free block against The Heart is good. If you have lots of cards Retained, that block every turn can actually save you.</li></ul><li><strong>In a worst-case scenario, can you block or resist up to 240 damage (16×15) from Blood Shots if you can’t kill The Heart when it has 16 Strength on or before turn 14?</strong></li><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>That’s a tough one for The Watcher. If you have a consistent and near-infinite Calm-Wrath loop with card draw and any combination of <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Power, 1 energy. Whenever you switch Stances, gain 4(6) Block.">Mental Fortress</span> and <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Attack, 1 energy. Deal 5(7) damage. Whenever you attack this enemy, gain 2(3) Block. Exhaust.">Talk to the Hand</span>, maybe. I wouldn’t rely too much on that, though. The Watcher will rarely need to take the fight that long because of how easy it is to deal damage with her.</p><li><strong>Do you rely on debuffs to kill enemies? If so, do you have enough debuff generation to burn through 2 stacks of Artifact reliably?</strong></li><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>The Watcher just needs herself to explode The Heart, but she may rely on <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Attack, 1 energy. Deal 5(7) damage. Whenever you attack this enemy, gain 2(3) Block. Exhaust.">Talk to the Hand</span>, which is a debuff, to generate block. In this case, it’s easier to have a good way to use <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Attack, 1 energy. Deal 5(7) damage. Whenever you attack this enemy, gain 2(3) Block. Exhaust.">Talk to the Hand</span> by turn four with card draw and <span class=tooltip data-tooltip="Skill, 4(3) energy. Choose a card in your draw pile. Play the chosen card twice and Exhaust it. Exhaust.">Omniscience</span>. If you don’t trust these two methods, I recommend getting Wave of The Hand for multi-Weak applications and burning these Artifacts in a single turn.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=runs data-injectable=false>What runs that beat The Heart look like</h2><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>Below you will find my runs where I took down the Heart with each of the four characters.

I have beaten The Heart on Ascension 20 with all characters multiple times, including mod characters like Wanderer and Hermit. I also have the Keys tattooed on my right arm because I love this game a little bit.</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=890 data-injectable=true>I know the Slay the Spire community, so I’m sure some people will read this guide and think since I’m not as proficient as Jorbs, Baalorlord, or TerrenceMHS, this guide isn’t good. That also means this guide is probably not for you and you’re looking for an even deeper conversation about the game. I recommend going to their YouTube channels and getting an even deeper look at successful A20 Heart runs, since they actually play this game for a living, unlike myself. You would actually be surprised how little time you have to play when you’re working with games.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>Now you go slay the spire.
