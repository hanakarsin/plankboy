In episode 72, we find out who hired Hit in order to kill Goku. You won’t believe who it is.</p><p>Before we find out who hired Hit, the beginning of the episode shows us where we left off in episode 71 of Dragon Ball Super. If you remember from last week, Goku “died” by a heart punch from Hit.</p><p>Gohan, Goten and Piccolo fly to his aid but to no avail. Even Piccolo cannot revive him. Thankfully, Goku shot out a Ki blast from his hand that went up into space. This Ki blast is now falling back down to Earth. Goku knew what he was doing after all and this blast is able to revive him back to life.</p><p>This was pretty clever in my opinion. Goku wasn’t truly dead, as he was in cardiac arrest. He just needed a huge jolt of energy in order to recover consciousness. The writers usually show Goku being dumb or naive, but he’s smart when it comes to martial arts and fighting.</p><p>Anyway, Goku says he wants to be a bit selfish and demands Hit to fight him again. After all, the job is not over since he’s not dead. Goku wants no interruptions so Gohan, Goten and Piccolo leave him to fight Hit alone.</p><p>Hit does come back, but he’s confident in his abilities. He has an “invisible attack” which is like a punch that can go past objects. Goku feels he knows how to avoid the attack. Hit also has another technique where he can confuse Goku by transporting his energy level to different locations.</p><img title="Dragon Ball Super Episode 72 Review: Who Hired Hit to Kill Goku?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dragon-ball-super-ssb-goku.jpg alt=dragon-ball-super-ssb-goku width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Despite the severity of the situation, Goku doesn’t seem to be scared for some reason. This shows us how Goku loves the thrill of fighting no matter if his life is in danger. Fighting is pretty much the only thing that Goku takes seriously.</p><p>In another scene, Vegeta can still be seen training with Whis over on Beerus’ planet. Vegeta tries to woo Whis by promising to give him steak dribbled with “Granny’s Secret Sauce”. We’ll explain this later in the episode…</p><p>Goku and Hit are still fighting and Goku is getting a little cocky. He tells Hit that he’s starting to figure his techniques out, although it’s not easy. Goku can only “scratch” Hit, but has yet to actually punch him.</p><p>Hit questions why Goku powers up all of the time as he can clearly see his blue aura. This doesn’t worry Goku at all. Goku vows that he will win this fight, even though Hit is more stronger than he was during the Universe tournament a couple of months ago.</p><p>We then see Vados and Champa watching the fight. Champa is dumb and doesn’t know how Hit’s “time skip” technique works and Vados has to explain it to him. Champa thinks Vados hired Hit in order to take Goku out before the next Universe tournament takes place. She says she only hired Hit due to someone else asking her to do it. Who is the real person that hired Hit to kill Goku?</p><p>As the fight goes on, Hit barricades himself while Goku goes all-out to fire off a Kamehameha. At this point of the fight, Vegeta, Whis and even Beerus are&nbsp;also watching.</p><img title="Dragon Ball Super Episode 72 Review: Who Hired Hit to Kill Goku?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dragon-ball-super-vados-champa.jpg alt=dragon-ball-super-vados-champa width=759 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Anyway, Goku fires off the Kamehameha and it appears Hit is knocked out. Goku has used all of his energy and both of them are tired laying down on the rocks. Everyone crowds around them, and they want to know who really hired Hit to kill Goku.</p><p>Beerus isn’t sure who hired Hit and asks if Vegeta does it. Vegeta denies it, and tells Goku why he likes fighting against Hit more than he does. They then find out from Goku’s guilty face that Goku himself hired Hit to kill him.</p><p>Goku’s reasoning is that he wanted to fight Hit at his best. This was also a very clever thing about this episode. I remember back in the Universe tournament that Goku said he was disappointed that Hit was holding back his powers because fighters were disqualified if they killed their opponents.</p><p>Whis says that Goku came up to him in secret begging him to hire Hit to kill him. Whis asked Vados and the deal was done. This angers Beerus as he says this was a reckless move. Whis defends himself by saying that it’s good training for Goku.</p><p>Hit on the other hand didn’t know Goku’s plan. Goku says he didn’t want to tell him in case he went easy on him. Goku says there’s no time limit on his own bounty so he can try and kill/fight him another time.</p><p>At this point Hit flies off and a worried Chi Chi comes. Goku whispers to Vegeta not to tell anyone that it was his own fault that Hit tried to kill him. The episode ends with Whis and Beerus demanding to try the steak with “Granny’s Secret Sauce” that Vegeta said earlier. Vegeta is scared as he made it up. He could ask Bulma’s mom to try and make something though.</p><p>Overall, episode 72 of Dragon Ball Super was really unique. Only a character like Goku would come up with a plan for an assassin to kill him. A&nbsp;storyline like this only works in Dragon Ball too, since characters come back from the dead multiple times. I was a little disappointed this arc only lasted 2 episodes, although it makes sense in the end. Nobody would have guessed that Goku hired Hit himself. A part of me thought Beerus did it in order to prepare him for the tournament.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnlKeuqLvNZpmapJxiwLa8xKtknqiZqLylsYxwaWaqlau2psOMsJ%2BoZZiev6awjKGgrWWkpHqstculZKCnm6p8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-72-review-who-hired-hit-to-kill-goku.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-72-review-who-hired-hit-to-kill-goku.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-72-review-who-hired-hit-to-kill-goku.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-72-review-who-hired-hit-to-kill-goku.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-72-review-who-hired-hit-to-kill-goku.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-72-review-who-hired-hit-to-kill-goku.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/elden-ring-how-to-play-with-friends-online-or-summon-npc-characters.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/elden-ring-how-to-play-with-friends-online-or-summon-npc-characters.html>Elden Ring How to Play With Friends Online or Summon NPC Characters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/destiny-2-tarnished-mettle-god-roll-best-perks-for-pvp-and-pve.html>Destiny 2 Tarnished Mettle God Roll: Best Perks for PvP and PvE</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/destiny-2-tarnished-mettle-god-roll-best-perks-for-pvp-and-pve.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
