After Twice’s question, Spinner realizes that only Toga and Shigaraki don’t have a villain name. She says she doesn’t want one, and the others start suggesting: Spinner says “the vampire Carmilla” and Twice “Pikachiu”</li><li data-index=1>Dabi says that all these suggestions are terrible, that these two names are references to things that existed before quirks appeared in this world and that she won’t be taken seriously. Compress then says that Dabi’s isn’t much better (Dabi means “cremation”)</li><li data-index=2>Shigaraki says that in the old days there was not clear distinction between heroes and villains, and that a theory says that your hero/villain name used to be given to you by your enemy. Some time after that, people started to come up with their own “secret identities” Toga is fascinated by this explanation and says that this is why she joined the League, because she wanted to help create a world that’s easier to live in. So she decides to continue living as Himiko Toga, without any other name</li><li data-index=3>Cut back to the present and Ochako has just been stabbed, but she still manages to say that she’s not trying to pity Toga. She touches her and activates Zero Gravity, Toga steps back but thinks to herself that being floating right now doesn’t bring any risk to her</li><li data-index=4>Toga then says that Uraraka is saying nice things now, but that later she will lock her in a cage and give her the death penalty. Or even worse: she’ll just kill her right here, like they did with Twice. It’s all about winning or losing, living or dying</li><li data-index=5>Uraraka says that Toga is just repeating what’s considered common sense, but Toga interrupts and says that if Ochako’s feeling is not pity, it can only be egoism. She uses a new move: “Dead Man’s Legion,” gathering multiple clones of several different people</li><li data-index=6>We see multiple panels of the heroes being attacked by the clones and the reporter girl in the helicopter is saying that the Quirk Doomsday Theory is coming true right now. The world is about to change by the feelings of a single girl</li><li data-index=7>Toga sends a wave of clones at Ochako, but she manages to defend herself with Gunhead Martial Arts. Toga says that just making them float is useless and Ochako replies that her quirk is not meant to hurt other people. Toga remembers what Uraraka said about Curious’ death</li><li data-index=8>Uraraka is still bleeding and screaming in pain. She admits that maybe she’s being egoistic, and that she can’t pretend that Toga never did anything wrong. But when she looks at her, she now understands that many circumstances must have led her to be the way she is today</li><li data-index=9>And this is why Toga was crying during the previous war. Toga gets even angrier, saying the tears were Uraraka’s fault and she agrees, but says it wasn’t just that. The first time they met in the forest, Ochako was afraid because she couldn’t understand her.</li><li data-index=10>But even during the forest fight, Toga still managed to smile in such a pure way. Toga tells her to shut up and starts reminiscing about Twice, with him saying that her not choosing a villain name was a great choice and that she should live the way she wants to.</li><li data-index=11>Uraraka says that she has already pushed Toga away once, and that she knows that this world is not ideal for people like her, but that she admires the fact that Toga can talk openly about the things and people she loves. At this moment, she thinks about Deku.</li><li data-index=12>The two are drawn like little kids and Uraraka says that Toga’s smile is so beautiful that it even makes her wish her’s could be like that. Toga remembers her parents saying that she looked like a deviant, and then Uraraka says “I can’t pretend I didn’t see you smiling”</li><li data-index=13>The two are crying and Uraraka’s fingers start to glow as lighting bolts come out of them. These bolts then spread across the battlefield and create an aura, causing the clones to float. Jiro realizes that Zero Gravity is spreading without Ochako touching the targets</li><li data-index=14>Ochako says she won’t ignore Toga’s past crimes and she won’t necessarily support everything she does from now on, but if Toga still wants to talk to her, she’s willing to give her her own blood for the rest of her life</li><li data-index=15>“I want to talk about love with you, Himiko-chan!”. Ochako reaches her hand full of blood toward Toga, and in the last panel of the chapter we see the two as kids once again, with Ochako offering her hand so little Toga can drink her blood and stop crying</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>My Hero Academia Chapter 393 Release Timeline</h2><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>The&nbsp;My Hero Academia Chapter 393 release timeline is scheduled for&nbsp;<strong>1:00 AM JST&nbsp;on&nbsp;Monday, July 10, 2023</strong>.
