The console, which has been Sony’s flagship for years, came out in 2013 and hosted millions of players for nearly eight years. Throughout these years, hundreds of amazing games have been released on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Playstation 4.</a> While some of them remained below the lofty standards, some of them found a place in our hearts with the stories they told. Here is that list: 10 Best Playstation 4 Games of All Time based on Metacritic.</p><p>To clarify though, this is not a personal list or a site list for Attack of the Fanboy.&nbsp; Rather it’s a list of the most highly rated games on the PlayStation 4 according to Metacritic.&nbsp; For each of these games AOTF did contribute to that Metacritic ranking as our reviews are included in the aggregator.&nbsp; You can find a link to our review for each game in the list below.</p><img title="10 Best Playstation 4 Games of All Time Based on Metacritic" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/journey-best-ps4-games-10.jpeg alt=journey-best-ps4-games-10 width=1920 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Journey (July 21, 2015) – 92</h3><p>Not only PlayStation 4 but perhaps one of the most unique games in-game history, <a href=#>Journey</a> is certainly deserved of being included in this list. Developed by the thatgamecompany, which has proven itself with games such as Flow and Flower, makes and incredibly strong case that video games are art. The average score of the game, which is unforgettable with its magnificent atmosphere and world design that detaches it from reality, is 92.</p><h3>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End (May 10, 2016) – 93</h3><p>Naughty Dog is almost synonymous with the PlayStation brand at this point.&nbsp; Over the last decade they have blessed us with numerous titles in some of the biggest franchises in gaming.&nbsp; The final chapter in the Uncharted series, Uncharted 4 earned it’s place on this list.&nbsp;<a href=#>Uncharted 4, telling the last adventure of Nathan Drake and his friends,</a> was one of the first big games of PlayStation 4. Uncharted 4 picked up where Uncharted 3 left off with its excellent gameplay mechanics, managed to enter this list with 93 points.</p><img title="10 Best Playstation 4 Games of All Time Based on Metacritic" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metal-gear-solid-v-best-ps4-games-8.jpg alt=metal-gear-solid-v-best-ps4-games-8 width=1920 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (September 1, 2015) – 93</h3><p>One of the <a href=#>most critically successful games o</a>f 2015, the first series that comes to mind when Hideo Kojima is mentioned, was The Phantom Pain. Featuring one of the most beloved main characters in the history of the game, Snake (aka Big Boss), the game was also Hideo Kojima’s first game to have an open world. The score for The Phantom Pain, Kojima Production’s only game on this list, is 93.</p><h3>Persona 5 (April 4, 2017) – 93</h3><p>Persona 5 took the series in a new direction, with a more palatable experience and the result was widespread critical praise. With completely new characters, unique technical details, and comic-like scenes, <a href=#>Persona 5 promised an experience that no other game could give.</a> The result was great too. Persona 5 reached an average of 93 points as a result of the positive reviews and became the seventh most successful PlayStation 4 game ever.</p><img title="10 Best Playstation 4 Games of All Time Based on Metacritic" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/the-last-of-us-part-2.jpeg alt=the-last-of-us-part-2 width=1919 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1919px) 100vw, 1919px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>The Last of Us Part II (June 19, 2020) – 93</h3><p>The most controversial game on the list is definitely <a href=#>The Last of Us Part II</a>. The reason why the sequel, which came years after the very successful first game, was so controversial was a decision it made in the story. That decision made some players so angry that the artists who played the characters even received death threats. However, this preference does not take anything from the quality of the game, of course. Because the game has taken its place in this list with an average of 93 points.</p><h3>God of War (April 20, 2018) – 94</h3><p>The God of War series, one of the most successful hack & slash games in history, appeared in a completely different way years after the third game. The completely revamped camera angle, the story moved from Greek mythology to Norse mythology, and the <a href=#>redefined Kratos</a> were so good that everyone loved the game. Cory Barlog and the wonderful team he worked with created a God of War we didn’t know we needed.</p><img title="10 Best Playstation 4 Games of All Time Based on Metacritic" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/The-Last-of-Us-Remastered.jpeg alt=The-Last-of-Us-Remastered width=1920 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>The Last of Us Remastered (July 29, 2014) – 95</h3><p>Arguably the best game on PlayStation 3 was <a href=#>The Last of Us</a>. At that time, Naughty Dog, which proved its success with Uncharted, had a great game in the last days of the console. Years have passed and that game is back in the Remastered version for PlayStation 4. As you can see from the average score of the game, there was only one masterpiece left for 2014.&nbsp; The Remastered version of this modern classic scored a whopping 95/100.</p><h3>Persona 5 Royal (March 31, 2020) – 95</h3><p>If you thought the Persona series couldn’t get any better than Persona 5, you would be wrong.&nbsp; <a href=#>Atlus one-upped themselves with the release of Persona 5 Royal</a>.&nbsp; Adding in some additional content while retaining all that goodness from the initial release made a good thing even better and critics rewarded that with an even higher score than the initial release at 95.</p><img title="10 Best Playstation 4 Games of All Time Based on Metacritic" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Grand-Theft-Auto-5.jpeg alt=Grand-Theft-Auto-5 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Grand Theft Auto V (November 18, 2014) – 97</h3><p>The Grand Theft Auto series is a franchise that continually tops itself.&nbsp; Rockstar Games doesn’t release a new one every year so the advancements made are revolutionary and this was certainly the case with GTA V.&nbsp; While the game did release on the PlayStation 3 initially, the PlayStation 4 version that followed was <a href=#>nothing short of a masterpiece</a>.&nbsp; Sitting at 97 it is the best PlayStation 4 game of all time.</p><h3>Red Dead Redemption 2 (October 26, 2018) – 97</h3><p>Just like Grand Theft Auto V, another Rockstar Games made title sits at the top of this list.&nbsp; Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterclass in open world games that has still yet to be rivaled.&nbsp; One of the most beautiful and realistic open worlds every created, the wild west comes alive in Red Dead Redemption 2.&nbsp; With Rockstar’s impeccable attention to the smaller details, great characters, compelling story, and jaw-dropping graphics there’s no wonder that it sits at the top of this list with a ranking of 97 and being the <a href=#>best PlayStation 4 game ever.</a></p><p>At the end of the day, it is best to pursue the beauty of the experiences of the games rather than the points they get, but from time to time it is necessary to go back and remember the legendary games. What do you think about the Best Playstation 4 Games of All Time list that emerged based on Metacritic scores? Which of the games like Bloodborne, Undertale, or The Witcher 3 that didn’t make it into the list but got quite high scores should be here?&nbsp; Let us know in the comments section below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWV6o7HSrWSppJGuwLWt06Kmp2VkYrSiucSsZKieXZa5rXnToqSeZZKWwKawjKilZqWVqa6kvsitoJxn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-best-playstation-4-games-of-all-time-based-on-metacritic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-best-playstation-4-games-of-all-time-based-on-metacritic.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-best-playstation-4-games-of-all-time-based-on-metacritic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-best-playstation-4-games-of-all-time-based-on-metacritic.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-best-playstation-4-games-of-all-time-based-on-metacritic.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-best-playstation-4-games-of-all-time-based-on-metacritic.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/all-baldurs-gate-3-fighting-styles-ranked.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/all-baldurs-gate-3-fighting-styles-ranked.html>All Baldur's Gate 3 Fighting Styles, Ranked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/you-should-play-as-a-girl-in-persona-3-portable-for-the-best-experience.html>You Should Play as a Girl in Persona 3 Portable for the Best Experience</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/you-should-play-as-a-girl-in-persona-3-portable-for-the-best-experience.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
