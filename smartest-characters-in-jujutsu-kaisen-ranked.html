Below, you will find a list of the smartest characters found in Jujutsu Kaisen.</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false><strong>Beware spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>A Ranking of the Smartest Characters in Jujutsu Kaisen</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>10. Aoi Todo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Todo-as-seen-in-the-series.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>The man who claims to have an IQ of 530,000, Aoi Todo may seem like a typical jock at first. However, when you look past his muscles and simplistic reasons to befriend people, you will find a brilliant strategist. With just a couple of seconds of analyzing an opponent, Aoi can come up with the perfect way to take them down.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>He can also use these analysis skills to help his allies, like Yuji, whom Aoi helped better control his powers. Todo can also use his ability Boogie Woogie, which allows him to interchange two beings with a clap, to overwhelm his opponents with surprise attacks. Sadly, his inexperience and reckless nature tend to work against him.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>9. Masamichi Yaga</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Yaga-with-one-of-his-dolls.jpg><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Better known for being the former principal of Jujutsu High, Yaga was a serious man who did his best to be a positive influence on those around him. He was Gojo’s teacher during his time at Jujutsu High, teaching the young sorcerer everything he needed to succeed in life. His most powerful and advanced technique was the ability to create independent cursed corpses.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>He could imbue dolls or dead bodies with his energy to turn them into living creatures that could aid him in fighting. He is also the one who created Panda, one of the most powerful Cursed Corpses in Jujutsu Kaisen. Sadly, he was not infallible, and could not defend himself against wiser, more experienced fighters.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>8. Mahito</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mahito-after-fighting-Nanami.jpg><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Mahito may look like a young teenager, but he is a Cursed Spirit who wanted to create a world without humans in it. Despite how unhinged he would normally act, Mahito was an intelligent fighter who knew exactly how to approach a fight. If his opponents were stronger than him, he would rarely attack directly, relying on deception and surprise attacks.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Dies in the Shibuya Incident Arc in Jujutsu Kaisen? [SPOILERS]</a></p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>If he would find himself fighting against someone who overpowered him, Mahito would always find a way to escape the confrontation as hastily as possible. However, he could still act childish, which often caused trouble not only for him but also for his allies.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>7. Yoshinobu Gakuganji</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gakuganji-playing-his-guitar.jpg><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Jujutsu Kaisen fans know that no matter how weak Gakuganji may look, this older gentleman is one of the most dangerous sorcerers you can fight against. He is a skilled cursed energy user, capable of controlling the beings around him to obey his every command. Few beings in the world of the series can resist his techniques.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>He is also an expert manipulator who could even trick his enemies into thinking he was an ally. Almost no one can detect when they are being tricked by Gakuganji. Nonetheless, he can sometimes act too overconfident, which can lead him to underestimate an opponent.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>6. Suguru Geto</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Geto-using-his-powers-against-a-village.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Gojo’s former best friend, a powerful sorcerer, and one of the most dangerous men in the world. Geto was a young man who wished to see a world where only sorcerers existed. He considered regular humans to be vermin since they were the cause behind the Cursed Spirits’ existence.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Geto could absorb any Curse Spirit he exorcised, to later use them for his own goals. He knew exactly which Curse he needed to use in any fight, and could also analyze his opponent’s moves after seconds of a fight commencing. Sadly, his arrogance and desire to change the world became his undoing, committing several mistakes during his last fight in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jujutsu Kaisen 0</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>5. Yuki Tsukumo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Yuki-meeting-Geto.jpg><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>One of the only Special Grade sorcerers in existence, Yuki was a passionate woman who wanted to create a curse-free world. She was a free spirit, unwilling to work for the higher-ups at Jujutsu High and working by herself. Many people considered her a lazy individual who did not want to take missions, but Yuki never cared about those rumors.</p><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 11 Jujutsu Kaisen’s Female Characters</a></p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>As a Special Grade, Yuki was not only a skilled sorcerer and amazing fighter, she was also a masterful strategist. She could confuse her opponents and taunt them until she could find an opening to attack. Even the mighty Kenjaku fell victim to her plans, almost being defeated during their match. Woefully, her analytical skills were not on par with that of her opponent, who ended up defeating her.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>4. Ryomen Sukuna</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sukuna-fighting-Megumi.jpg><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>In the past, Sukuna was a Jujutsu sorcerer who was feared and revered for his immense power. Before his death, he turned himself into a Curse Spirit, hoping to be reborn in a new body and continue with his reign of terror. Sukuna has one of the most powerful minds in the franchise. He knows almost all subjects about sorcery and can use them to his advantage.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>He is also a conniving individual who can convince or coerce others into doing his bidding. Sukuna is constantly several steps ahead of his opponents, predicting their next moves or manipulating their feelings. Nonetheless, his only desire is to destroy and revel in the pain he causes, so he prefers to rely on raw strength instead of planned attacks most of the time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>3. Satoru Gojo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gojo-preparing-to-fight.jpg><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Satoru is a member of the prestigious Gojo family, one of the most respected sorcerer clans in the world. He is also the first member of this family to have been born with the abilities Limitless and Six Eyes. These skills combined not only turned Satoru into the strongest sorcerer of his generation, but also increased his fighting ability, strategic thinking, and overall intelligence.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>After just a couple of seconds of analyzing his enemy, Gojo can come up with different strategies and moves to neutralize them. He is also a convincing actor and a masterful orator. He has been able to trick Jujutsu High’s higher-ups on more than one occasion. Yet, Gojo is still a mortal man who has not lived or experienced as much as the true masterminds of Jujutsu Kaisen.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>2. Kenjaku</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kenjaku-in-Getos-Body.jpg><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Considered by many the most terrifying and threatening Curse Spirit to have ever been conceived, Kenjaku is an ancient evil who has lived for centuries. He created a technique that allowed him to transplant his brain into corpses, taking control of them and giving him access to the abilities his hosts had in life.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Kenjaku is the being behind all the pain and suffering that our heroes have been subjected to in the series. He does not care about power or transforming the world, he only wants to find a being who can challenge his power and intellect. Nevertheless, it is his lack of true motivation that prevents him from being the most intelligent character in the series.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>1. Tengen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tengen-in-the-manga.jpg><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Tengen is a sorcerer who has lived for centuries thanks to his Cursed Technique, which grants him immortality. During his time as a regular human, Tengen was one of the founders of Jujutsu, passing his knowledge and his abilities on to anyone who wished to learn. Now, centuries later, he continues to do so, being one of the pillars who keeps the world under control.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=false>He has centuries of knowledge and experience to aid him and his allies, a fact that has been demonstrated several times in the series. Without him, every Jujutsu Academy would have fallen already, as he is the one who guides and protects these institutions. Tengen is without a doubt the wisest being in Jujutsu Kaisen.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
