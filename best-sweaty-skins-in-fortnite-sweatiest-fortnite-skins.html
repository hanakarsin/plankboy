<time>11 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=335 data-injectable=true data-video=true>If you’re big into the world of&nbsp;<strong>Fortnite</strong>, you may have noticed that players wearing certain skins seem to try just a little too hard to appear skilled at the game. Some skins will unfortunately always carry a stigma of being&nbsp;<strong>sweaty</strong> — a term that stems from trying so hard in the game that you’re sweating in real life.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>In this article, we’ll explore the skins that have been permanently branded with this stigma. That way, you’ll know which players in your next game need to be sent a care package of deodorant.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Top 15 Sweatiest Skins in Fortnite</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Crystal</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Krystal-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Slender female skins are the holy grail of “sweaty” skins in Fortnite. While all hitboxes are identical, regardless of the skin being used, many tryhard players still believe this misconception and latch on to skins like Crystal. Especially since she only costs 800 V-Bucks and regularly appears in the Item Shop.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>B.R.U.T.E. Gunner</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Brute-Gunner-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>While slimmer skins don’t have the hitbox advantage many players believe they do, they can be more difficult to spot because of their size. B.R.U.T.E. Gunner is popular for this very reason, along with her (near) all-black color scheme. Just don’t mention the actual B.R.U.T.E. to sweats.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Lynx</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lynx-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Lynx was given to players immediately when purchasing the Chapter One, Season Seven Battle Pass. Fortnite was exploding with popularity at this time and was the starting point for many dedicated players. Those that use Lynx can show how long they’ve played while using a sleek skin. The most popular style for sweats is the black color scheme at stage 3 with no tail.</p><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get Free Skins in Fortnite</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Aura</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aura-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>While this used to be much more common in the early days of Fortnite, quite a few sweaty players are still using the Aura skin. While it’s a fairly standard skin, for the most part, the lack of extras on her body makes it so you’re able to see much more around you, giving you more field of view than ever before, and players utilize that to their full potential when playing with the Aura skin. Be prepared for a good fight if you come across one of these skins in the game.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Renegade Raider</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Renegade-Raider-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>While the Renegade Raider doesn’t scare the same stigma that it used to, be prepared to face off against a true Fortnite veteran if you come across one of these in-game. As (arguably) the rarest skin in the game, you’ll likely be going against a player with a lot of experience and one unafraid to show it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Spiderman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fortnite-Spider-Man-.jpg><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>When players see someone with a Spider-Man skin in Fortnite, they know that they are up against one of the easiest players that they’ve ever encountered or someone that is about to build an entire city in front of them in the blink of an eye. While the designs that were picked are classic, the way that players who don this skin act most of the time makes us wonder how they get the suit off when they get home, since it’s usually stuck to their skin with so much sweat.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Wildcat</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WIldcat-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>Equipping Wildcat as your skin shows a true dedication to taking irregular showers. This skin was available exclusively with a Nintendo Switch console bundle, and now goes for obscene amounts on auction and code-selling sites. If someone had the cash to splash on her, it’s very likely they’re going to pop a blood vessel while box building — that or just an innocent kid that received a Switch for their birthday.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Skull Trooper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fortnite-Skull-Trooper.jpg><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Skull Trooper was originally one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rarest skins in Fortnite</a> until it was re-released in a Halloween update. Players that owned Skull Trooper prior to its return were granted an exclusive purple style to solidify their status as an “OG” player. Special style or not, Skull Trooper has become a favorite among veteran sweats due to its history and prominence.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Naruto Skins</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fortnite-naruto-sasuke-sakura-and-kakashi-outfits-1920x1080-03fb4a1e5fbc-1280x720.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Another exciting skins selection makes its way into the game, almost instantly ruined by gamers that are trying way too hard to be like their favorite Ninja from the Naruto series. Normally, if you see a whole squad decked out in the Naruto Skins, you know that you’re in for lots of leaping, shooting, and dashing around, but more often than not, you’ll have an easier time taking the squad down than you’d expect.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Reaper (OG John Wick)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-Reaper-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>If you’ve been around long enough to remember The Reaper, you’ll remember the instant comparisons that it drew to John Wick, and for that reason, it became one of the most popular skins to dunk on. While the actual John Wick may officially be in the game now, players that earned The Reaper are strong enough to hunt you down and quickly dispose of you, so beware if you see one of these knockoff Wicks hanging out in your game.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Sparkplug</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sparkplug-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Fortnite pros instantly fell in love with Sparkplug when she was first announced and for good reason. The color of her complexion, as well as her outfit in general, made her a perfect character to indulge in <strong>box fights</strong> right off of the bat, so you’ll need to be careful where you’re walking if you happen to spot a Sparkplug in your lobby. Make sure that you’re checking every corner, and every tan area to see if she’s hiding around the bend.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Dummy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dummy-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>While being one of the easier skins to spot, thanks to its bright yellow design, the Dummy skin has one key advantage over some of the other skins that are on this list. Its tiny midsection makes Dummy slightly harder to aim at, even with all Fortnite skins sharing the same hitbox. While this is barely an advantage, it’s common for sweats to obsess over min-maxing gameplay advantages. Make sure to aim for the head, and not the torso, if you come across Dummy in your lobby.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Soccer (Original)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Fortnite-Soccer-Skins.jpg><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>Being able to support your favorite sport inside of your favorite video game is actually kind of cool, but when you’ve got your whole squad decked out in soccer gear, with matching numbers and colors, that feels a little sweaty. While you’re spending time running on the field, you’re going to feel the real sweat when you get ambushed by players using the same skin and number combination, so you don’t know who you’ve been focusing your fire on.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Chaos Agent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Chaos-Agent-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>One of the main reasons that this skin is considered Sweaty as it falls into the same category as the Dummy above. Chaos Agent is incredibly thin and nimble, allowing players to potentially avoid a few extra shots to the waist, while also being almost fully black, making this one hard to spot in darker areas. Its initial price and rarity have made this one of the sweatiest skins to get in Fortnite, so be careful if you come across one of these skins in your game.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Boundless</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boundless-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>This is one of the worst offenders on the list, actually leading to this particular set of skins being banned from competitive play. When these Superhero skins were first released, players were able to give skin a completely uniform color scheme, so instantly, players began making fully whited-out or blacked-out skins that made it near impossible to see in specific areas of the map. Thankfully, you can no longer do this, but if you happen to have this skin saved, you would have been able to save your favorite layout, leading to some players still using this in matches.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>Don’t forget to check out our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite tag page</a> for more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lists</a> and guides on the latest content, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">weekly quests</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">events</a>, and free cosmetics.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
