With the Witch Queen expansion, Destiny 2 Subclasses are getting slowly reworked. The first Subclass to see this rework was Void 3.0. Now that Solar 3.0 is finally here with <a href=# rel=noopener>Season of the Haunted</a>, here are the best builds for Solar 3.0 in Destiny 2.</p><h2>Destiny 2 Solar 3.0 Warlock Build</h2><p>The Warlock Solar 3.0 build <strong>focuses either on AoE damage or healing</strong>. The Super choices are Daybreak, which was the existing Super that allows you to throw flaming swords at enemies, or <strong>Well of Radiance</strong> which will have you thrust your sword into the ground which scorches nearby enemies while healing and increasing weapon damage to allies in the radius.</p><p>The Class Abilities are either Healing Rift, Empowering Rift, or Phoenix Dive which will ground you and cure nearby allies with Solar Light. This <strong>pairs extremely well with the Heat Rises Aspect</strong>, which allows you to shoot, throw grenades, and melee while gliding, because you’ll gain restoration while diving and scorch enemies upon landing.</p><p>There are no changes to the Glide options, but the Solar Melee allows for Celestial Fire, which was already an option, or <strong>Incinerator Snap</strong>. Both are ranged melee abilities, but the Incinerator Snap Scorches enemies which deals damage over time. If enough Scorch stacks are applied to an enemy, they ignite which deals a large Solar explosion.</p><p>There are a lot of <strong>new Grenades</strong> to customize your build. The Incendiary, Solar, Thermite, Fusion, Firebolt, and Swarm Grenades are old news but they did all receive a facelift by adding Scorch to all of them, making them all powerful in their own right. New to Warlocks are Tripmine Grenades which cause scorching damage and the <strong>Healing Grenade</strong>. If you want to lean into the healing build, this Grenade is a must as it cures all allies with Solar Light and restores health and shields over time.</p><p>For <strong>Aspects</strong>, there is Icarus Dash, Touch of Flame, and Heat Rises. Icarus Dash allows you to dodge while airborne and adds another dodge when you have Heat Rises on. Touch of Flame enhances the Healing, Solar, Firebolt, and Fusion Grenades, so pair those strategically.</p><p>There are a ton of great <strong>Fragments</strong> to choose from. If you are going for a crowd control build, look to equip Fragments that highlight Scorch, Discipline, and Strength. If you are going for the healer builder, look for support Fragments like Ember of Tempering and anything with Restoration, Cure, and Radiant.</p><h2>Destiny 2 Solar 3.0 Titan Build</h2><p>With Solar 3.0, Titans have been overhauled to <strong>deal tons of damage</strong>. Hammer of Sol is the original Solar Super for Titans and the new one is <strong>Burning Maul</strong>. Where Hammer of Sol gives you range like Warlock’s Daybreak, Burning Maul gives you a giant hammer to deal damage up close and personal.</p><p>The Class Abilities of Towering Barricade and Rally Barricade are unchanged as well as the Movement Abilities. What has been added is the <strong>Throwing Hammer</strong> Solar Melee ability. In typical Titan fashion, Hammer Strike still remains a choice for the Solar Melee, but the Throwing Hammer allows for distance and can be picked back up to recharge your melee. If you pick it up after hitting a target, you’ll gain Cure.</p><p>Like Void 3.0, all Guardians share the same <strong>Solar Grenade</strong> options. For the Titan build, you’ll want to equip a Grenade that deals instant damage. You can’t go wrong with the Incendiary, Solar, or Fusion Grenades.</p><p>The best<strong> Aspect</strong> that you will definitely want to equip is Consecration. This Aspect allows you to do a Solar uppercut that scorches enemies and a ground pound that ignites any scorched enemies. This has a large AoE and will deal massive damage. The other Aspects to consider are Roaring Flames which increases the damage of your Solar abilities when enemies die from Solar or ignitions and Sol Invictus which creates Sunspots after Solar kills which regenerates your abilities faster.</p><p>If you are building the ultimate Sun God Titan, the <strong>Fragments</strong> you’ll need to be focused on are any that highlight Solar scorching and ignitions. Anything that will boost your Strength, Intelligence, and Discipline are also great picks. Avoid Cure and Restoration Fragments and, unless you really want some support functionality, avoid Radiant as well.</p><h2>Destiny 2 Solar 3.0 Hunter Build</h2><p>Last, but not least, we have Hunters Solar 3.0. Unsurprisingly, Solar 3.0 Hunters are Gunslingers that <strong>focus on trick shots</strong>. There are three Solar 3.0 Super options: Golden Gun – Deadshot, Golden Gun – Marksman, and Blade Barrage. We’ve seen Blade Barrage— it lets you launch multiple Solar-charged explosive knives at enemies. The difference between <strong>Deadshot and Marksman</strong> is that Deadshot is more <a href=# rel=noopener>rapid-firing</a> and, if you cause ignitions, you’ll get more Golden Gun ammo. Marksman focuses on precision damage that creates Orbs of Power.</p><p>Hunters Class Ability is either Marksman’s Dodge or Gambler’s Dodge which we have seen. The new Class Ability is <strong>Acrobat’s Dodge</strong> which gives you an acrobatic leap followed by creating a well of Radiant, which increases weapon damage for all within it. This new Class Ability will be interesting when paired with a support Warlock.</p><p>The Movement Abilities remain the same but Bungie really loves Hunters as seen through the option of four Solar Melee abilities. The best <strong>Solar Melee</strong> ability to choose if you want to maximize your trick shot sneaky Hunter is the Lightweight Knife which on precision hits makes you Radiant or the <strong>Weighted Throwing Knife</strong> which deals extra precision damage and causes ignition to scorched enemies. Precision final blows also immediately recharge the Solar Melee.</p><p>When it comes to <strong>Solar Grenades</strong>, Hunters are best off setting traps. Pick the Tripmine or Swarm Grenade, especially for PvP to get the most out of the Hunter build. If you’re playing PvE, choosing the Fusion or Solar Grenade are good options.</p><p>The <strong>Aspects</strong> worth equipping for the Hunter are Knock ‘Em Down which enhanced whichever Solar Super you are using while fully refunding your Throwing Knife with radiant kills. The other extremely powerful Aspect is Gunpowder Gamble which acts as another grenade that after being thrown can be shot to deal devastating ignition to enemies around. The On Your Mark Aspect improves weapon handling and reload speed after final blows.</p><p>The <strong>Fragments</strong> to choose for the best Solar 3.0 Hunter build are any that focus on Radiant. You’ll also want to prioritize anything that buffs Strength as your Throwing Knife will be essential.</p><p>Whether you play Titan, Hunter, or Warlock, <strong>Solar 3.0 in Destiny 2</strong> offers a lot of new and exciting strategies to try.
