Some <a href=#>Fortnite skins</a> are fairly easy to come by, but others are so rare you might only ever see them once or twice in all your time playing Fortnite Battle Royale.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Only so many skins can be in the shop, so naturally, some rare skins never see the light of day after their initial debut, making them incredibly rare. Some exclusive skins weren’t even available for purchase via conventional means, only being given to those who bought physical products or console bundles.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>These following skins are some of the <strong>rarest skins in Fortnite.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Skull Trooper (Purple Glow)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fortnite-Skull-Trooper.jpg><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>The <strong>Skull Trooper</strong> skin is probably the first skin that comes to mind for many people when they think of rare Fortnite skins. This elusive skin first appeared in Fortnite’s item shop in October 2017, just when Fortnite began its meteoric rise to the top of the battle royale scene.</p><p>While Skull Trooper now reappears every Halloween, an exclusive ‘Purple Glow’ edit style was granted to players that purchased Skull Trooper when it was first released. This style is entirely unavailable to all other players, causing heads to turn whenever any enter the lobby.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get XP Fast – Fortnite Map Codes</a> on Touch Tap Play</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Royale Bomber</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Royale-Bomber-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>The <strong>Royale Bomber </strong>has become a bit easier to acquire since it was released, but it’s still one of the more expensive skins Fortnite has to offer. Originally, <strong>Royale Bomber</strong> was bundled with select PlayStation 4 consoles, which was the only way to get it for some time.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>The skin was later bundled with select DualShock 4 controllers, but those seem to have sold out just as quickly as the PS4 bundles, making the skin very hard to find today.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Galaxy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fortnite-Galaxy.jpg><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Galaxy</strong> skin is one of the more well-known Fortnite skins. Before Fortnite was officially released on mobile devices, the Android beta was available early exclusively on Samsung phones. Anyone who went the extra step and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 or Samsung Note 9 got the <strong>Galaxy</strong> skin.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>On top of initially only being available on a select few expensive mobile devices, the <strong>Galaxy </strong>skin isn’t even offered to Samsung users anymore (as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glow replaced it</a>), truly making it one of Fortnite’s rarest skins.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Reaper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-Reaper-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>The John Wick skin before the John Wick skin, <strong>The Reaper</strong> was the ultimate status symbol in the early days of Fortnite. It was included in the Chapter One, Season Three Battle Pass, only awarded to those who reached Tier 100. Maxing out the Battle Pass is no easy task. Considering this skin was only available during Season Three, not many people had the opportunity to obtain it because Fortnite wasn’t the gigantic global phenomenon it is today.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false><strong>The Reaper</strong> has never been made available outside of the Season Three Battle Pass, so you can’t get it anymore. At least there’s always the actual John Wick skin based on the movie.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Knight</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Black-Knight-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>Just like <strong>The Reaper</strong>, the <strong>Black Knight</strong> skin was only available to the earliest Fortnite players. The <strong>Black Knight</strong> was rewarded to those who maxed out the Chapter One, Season Two Battle Pass, which was capped at Tier 70, unlike recent Battle Passes.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>The Season Two Battle Pass was actually the first Battle Pass in Fortnite history, making the <strong>Black Knight</strong> the first-ever max-tier Battle Pass skin. Season Two of Fortnite didn’t see as many players as the game has today, so hardly anyone playing the game today has this skin unless they were there from the beginning.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Renegade Raider</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Renegade-Raider-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Going back even further in the Fortnite timeline, <strong>Renegade Raider </strong>is a rare skin that was only available during Chapter One, Season One — the earliest days of Fortnite Battle Royale. This skin is so old it predates the Battle Pass.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>There weren’t a lot of players during the first season, so not many people had the opportunity to earn this skin. To obtain it, you would have had to reach Level 20 during Season One and then buy the <strong>Renegade Raider </strong>skin for 1,200 V-Bucks. If you see someone with this skin, they’ve been with Fortnite since the very beginning.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Dark Voyager</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dark-Voyager-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false><strong>Dark Voyager </strong>was a very common skin when Fortnite was just starting to become popular. Unlocked by reaching Tier 70 of the Chapter One, Season Three Battle Pass, almost every dedicated Fortnite player back then earned this skin.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Now, two years later, not many people are still rocking their Season Three skins. That means you won’t see <strong>Dark Voyager </strong>on the Battle Bus very often anymore, making it one of the game’s rarest skins by default. As Fortnite gets more and more players, this skin will only get rarer, too.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Aerial Assault Trooper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aerial-Assault-Trooper-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Another skin that’s rare simply due to its age is the <strong>Aerial Assault</strong> <strong>Trooper</strong>. Like the Renegade Raider skin, the Aerial Assault Trooper was only available in Chapter One, Season one. It cost the same price, 1,200 V-Bucks, but you only had to reach Level 15 to be able to purchase it.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>While the Level requirement isn’t as high, fewer people bought the Aerial Assault Trooper because of how unassuming and boring it looks. Of the skins in season one, Renegade Raider had one of the most unique looks, so most people elected to spend their V-Bucks on that instead, making this skin one of Fortnite’s rarest.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Double Helix</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Double-Helix-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Double Helix </strong>skin was only available as part of a Nintendo Switch bundle in late 2018, making it one of Fortnite’s rarest skins and also one of the game’s most expensive skins. You had to buy an entire console just to get your hands on this skin.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Even if you wanted to go out and get Double Helix right now, you wouldn’t be able to. The <strong>Double Helix </strong>Nintendo Switch bundle has been sold out at every retailer for a long time now, so the only way to get this skin is to buy one from a third-party seller at a super high price.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Ragnarok</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ragnarok-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>When it launched, <strong>Ragnarok </strong>might not have been a very rare skin, but so much time has passed since that it has become one of the harder skins to find in Fortnite. Ragnarok was the Tier 100 Battle Pass reward in Chapter One, Season Five, so only the most dedicated Fortnite players could acquire this skin.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>Even rarer is the maxed-out Stage 6 style, which requires you to earn tons of XP to unlock. <strong>Ragnarok </strong>is already a rare skin, and it will only become rarer as time goes on.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Sparkle Specialist</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sparkle-Specialist-Skin-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Like many of the skins on this list, <strong>Sparkle Specialist </strong>could only be obtained during the early days of Fortnite. It was unlocked by reaching Tier 56 of the Chapter One, Season Two Battle Pass.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>This skin was actually pretty popular during Season Two, but considering it was so long ago, not many people have it or use it anymore, and it’s unlikely that new players will ever get a chance to get it for themselves.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Glow</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Glow-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Like the <strong>Galaxy </strong>skin, the <a href=#><strong>Glow </strong>skin</a> is a Samsung promotional skin, although you could get it on a much larger selection of devices. The promotional period has ended, though, so nobody can get this skin anymore.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>This skin is one of Fortnite’s rarest just because of the cost. Only those with relatively new Samsung devices could redeem the <strong>Glow </strong>skin, so a large percentage of Fortnite’s player base was alienated.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Omega</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Omega-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Because each Battle Pass is limited to one season, Battle Pass skins get rarer and rarer as time goes on. <strong>Omega </strong>was the reward for reaching Tier 100 in the Chapter One, Season Four Battle Pass.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Season Four was a long time ago, and very few Fortnite players are still rocking their <strong>Omega </strong>skins, thus making it one of Fortnite’s rarest.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How Many People Play Fortnite? How to Check Player Count Statistics</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Honor Guard</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Honor-Guard-Fornite.jpg><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Many of Fortnite’s rarest skins are tied to certain devices, and <strong>Honor Guard </strong>is no different. This skin is only available to those that purchase the Honor View 20 smartphone, which is very expensive and much less common than a Samsung phone.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>When the promotion first began, the skin wasn’t even available in the United States, forcing dedicated Fortnite fans to import an expensive device if they wanted the Honor Guard skin. The phone has since been released globally, but its asking price is still considerable.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Brilliant Bomber</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brilliant-Bomber-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true><strong>Brilliant Bomber</strong>, by far, is the rarest skin in Fortnite. Epic Games had planned to introduce the ‘Annual Pass’ to Fortnite in 2020, which would include 7 exclusive cosmetics, free ‘Battle Bundles’, and 25% off content in the Battle Pass throughout the year. The Annual Pass was scrapped and never made it to live servers, being replaced with ‘Fortnite Crew’ in December 2020 instead.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>However, some players managed to purchase the Annual Pass through Fortnite’s API and were rewarded Brilliant Bomber, the first exclusive Annual Pass cosmetic. Most accounts had the skin removed from their account and were subsequently punished. However, a very, very small amount of players somehow managed to avoid this punishment and still have Brilliant Bomber to this day.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Widow Outfit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Black-Widow-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Today, Fortnite has an abundance of unique Marvel skins that are regularly available in the shop. It wasn’t always this way, though. In one of Fortnite’s first-ever collaborations, Epic Games released <strong>Black Widow Outfit </strong>and <strong>Star-Lord Outfit</strong> to coincide with the release of Avengers: Infinity War. These skins used existing models and added outfits to resemble Black Widow and Star-Lord respectively.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>In November 2020, <strong>Black Widow (Snow Suit)</strong> was released, which featured a completely unique model that resembles Black Widow much better. Since then, <strong>Black Widow Outfit</strong> has yet to reappear, appearing to be completely replaced by its fancier-looking counterpart. As Star-Lord is yet to receive another skin, <strong>Star-Lord Outfit</strong> still regularly appears in the Item Shop.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Travis Scott and Astro Jack</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Travis-Scott-and-Astro-Jack-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true><strong>Travis Scott</strong> and <strong>Astro Jack</strong> were only available to purchase between April 22 – 27, 2020. The two skins based on the famous rapper were released alongside Travis Scott’s in-game live event concert, Astroworld. Due to Travis’ real-world controversies in recent years, it’s doubtful that <strong>Travis</strong> or <strong>Astro Jack</strong> will ever return, solidifying them as some of Fortnite’s rarest skins.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Special Forces</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Special-Forces-Fortnite-Skin.jpg><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true><strong>Special Forces</strong> is a skin from <strong>Chapter One, Season One</strong>. Unlike Renegade Raider and Aerial Assault Trooper, <strong>Special Forces</strong> has made his return several times between 2017 and early 2019 but has yet to make a reappearance since.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>At the time of writing, <strong>Special Forces</strong> has been absent from the Item Shop for <strong>over 1500</strong> days, currently holding the record for the <strong>rarest Item Shop skin</strong>.</p><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get Free Skins in Fortnite</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Stealth Reflex and Reflex</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Stealth-Reflex-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false><strong>Stealth Reflex</strong> is a skin with an interesting tale behind it. Players that purchased select NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards in 2018 would receive a bundle of cosmetics advertised as “exclusive,” including the <strong>Reflex</strong> skin.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>However, <strong>Reflex</strong> became available to purchase in the <strong>Item Shop</strong> in March 2019. To apologize for the error, Epic Games granted players that redeemed the bundle a new exclusive skin, <strong>Stealth Reflex</strong>.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>The initial purchase requirement, combined with its unusual circumstances, makes <strong>Stealth Reflex</strong> one of Fortnite’s rarest promotion skins. <strong>Reflex</strong> himself has also been absent from the Item Shop ever since.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>World Warrior</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/World-Warrior-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false><strong>World Warrior</strong> was a skin used to promote the 2019 Fortnite World Cup. It was only available in the Item Shop for <strong>three days</strong> and has been confirmed never to return.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>Being the first limited-time Fortnite World Cup skin — and Fortnite World Cup in general — players had yet to catch on to how coveted this skin would become, opting to spend their V-Bucks on more flashy skins.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Golden Agent Peely</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gold-Agent-Peely-Fortnite.jpg><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>While <strong>Agent Peely</strong> himself isn’t a particularly rare skin, being the Level 1 Battle Pass reward for Chapter Two, Season Two. What is incredibly rare, however, is his ‘Golden Agent’ Edit Style.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>During this season, players could earn Edit Styles for Battle Pass skins that progressively became more golden as they leveled up.
