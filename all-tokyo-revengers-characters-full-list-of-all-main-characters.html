If you’re getting into the series for the first time, you might want to know who the Tokyo Revengers main characters are.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Who Are the Main and Supporting Characters of Tokyo Revengers?</h2><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>The cast of Tokyo Revengers features fascinating characters with varying roles in Takemichi’s journey. The cast feature on various levels across the timeline, affected in different ways by Takemichi’s time-hopping, and they are listed below:</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Takemichi Hanagaki</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Takemichi-Hanagaki-Tokyo-Revengers-Characters.jpg><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>Takemichi is the protagonist of the series, a 26-year-old who finds his fate forever changed after his ex-girlfriend Hinata and her brother Naoto were murdered by the Tokyo Manji Gang (or Toman). He soon discovers he has the ability to travel through time, which he uses to save Naoto and find a way to prevent Hinata’s death. It’s through this time travel that he also falls in with the Toman and even climbs its leadership ladder throughout the series.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Hinata Tachibana</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hinata-Tachibana.jpeg><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Hinata, or Hina, starts as a sort of Lost Lenore of the series, her passing being Takemichi’s primary reason for using his time-traveling powers to change the past. A kind, optimistic individual who doesn’t let others fall into despair, she is courageous and will stand up for people she cares about; her character is an important one throughout Tokyo Revengers.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Naoto Tachibana</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Naoto-Tachibana-Tokyo-Revengers-Characters.jpg><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Naoto was saved at first by Takemichi creating a time paradox where he lived on to work in law enforcement, bent on saving his sister as well. Naoto has a no-nonsense personality and is relatively unphased even by the bizarre ability Takemichi has to travel through time. His deductive abilities as a detective have made him an asset to Takemichi as he tries to alter the timeline.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Manjiro Sano</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Manjiro-Sano-Tokyo-Revengers-Characters.jpg><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Known as “The Invincible Mikey,” Manjiro is a founding member of the Toman who previously led the Kanto Manji Gang, renowned for his fierce fighting ability. Originally seen as a carefree prankster, Manjiro has a dark past that steers him to a dark future that Takemichi must also work to prevent. Manjiro, or “Mikey,” is possibly the most important character other than Takemichi.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Ken Ryuguji</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ken-Ryuguji.jpg><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Also known as “Draken” and founding member of the Toman who is often seeking a worthy fighting opponent. He has occasionally provided counsel to Mikey and prevented things from getting worse, but Draken has a temper of his own to which he occasionally gives in, and is a caring, loyal friend.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Keisuke Baji</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Keisuke-Baji-Tokyo-Revengers-Characters.jpg><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Another founding member of the Toman, Baji can be somewhat unhinged and attack others potentially unprovoked but is also a loyal friend. He’s a character who also represents the Toman sense of honor.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Takashi Mitsuya</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Takashi-Mitsuya.jpg><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>A more peaceful Toman founding member, Mitsuya is also a protective brother to his siblings, Luna and Mana, acting as a parent to them in their absentee mother.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Haruki Hayashida</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Haruki-Hayashida-Tokyo-Revengers-Characters.jpg><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Also known as Pah-chin, Haruki is a terse and rude individual who undergoes significant character development as the series goes on. Another Toman founding member.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Tetta Kisaki</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Tetta-Kisaki.jpg><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=true>The main antagonist of Tokyo Revengers. A ruthless manipulator who sees his subordinates as tools, Kisaki has had a hand in multiple characters’ fates, including those of Hinata, Takemichi, and Mikey. His fragile ego has proven to be his biggest flaw, fueling much of his character arc, and putting crucial moments in the series in motion. He’s not a powerful adversary like in other Shonen anime, but rather an evil mastermind who uses the impressionable and vulnerable gang members at his disposal for his own ill gains.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Shuji Hanma</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Shuji-Hanma-Tokyo-Revengers-Characters.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Originally one of Kisaki’s comrades and right-hand man, a sadist who enjoys the fallout of actions planned by himself and Kisaki, and doesn’t seem to mind being manipulated. He is a cruel fighter addicted to the rush that combat brings him, although is frequently disappointed by weaker opponents.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Chifuyu Matsuno</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Chifuyu-Matsuno.jpg><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>A calm, compassionate individual, Chifuyu does his best to advise Takemichi when he can, and thinks before he acts. He also refuses to use his strength to dominate or put himself above others.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Kazutora Hanemiya</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kazutora-Hanemiya.jpg><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>A tragic character and a survivor of domestic violence at home, and dangerously loyal to Mikey and Toman as a way to make up for an otherwise empty family life. A paradoxical individual whose mixed views on killing (killing people is bad to him, but killing enemies is okay) have caused him to be manipulated into some truly regretable deeds.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Additional Characters</h3><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>For those not mentioned above, there are a few other supporting characters listed below each with their own signature quirks you can discover as the series progresses:</p><ul data-found-items=10 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true><li>Ryohei Hayashi</li><li>Nahoya Kawata</li><li>Yasuhiro Muto</li><li>Masataka Kiyomizu</li><li>Atsushi Sendo</li><li>Takuya Yamamoto</li><li>Makoto Suzuki</li><li>Kazushi Yamagishi</li><li>Emma Sano</li><li>Nobutaka Osanai</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>When Does the Tokyo Revengers Anime Come Back, and Where Can I Watch?</h3><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Tokyo Revengers will have a second season on January 2023, adapting the “Christmas Showdown” or “Black Dragon” arc which spans 44 chapters from the manga between chapters 78 and 141.
