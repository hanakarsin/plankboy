Meaning that, when mastered, any of the below can truly excel. With that said, this list was made taking into consideration their overall performance against the game’s current roster, as well as their kits as a whole.</li></ul><h2 data-injectable=false>All S-Tier Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2</h2><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false><strong>Currently, the best, or S-tier tanks in Overwatch 2 are Reinhardt, Orisa, Sigma, and everyone’s favorite pro-gamer turned watchful protector D.VA</strong>. You can check why each of them excels in the field below:</p><h3 class="text-neutral-grey font-display font-bold mb-5 text-title-4" data-cy=Heading data-waterfall=false data-injectable=false>Reinhardt</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Reinhardt-best-tanks.jpg alt=Reinhardt-best-tanks width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Well, it’s no surprise that he would be here, right? <strong>Reinhardt</strong> is considered by many as one of the best offense-oriented tanks in the game, thanks to his ability to both hold his ground and literally crush enemies when needed. With that said, he has in his Barrier Field his biggest strength, as the ability allows your damage and support heroes to stay protected while picking open targets. The skill also pairs up extremely well with his Charge ability.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Orisa</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Orisa-overwatch-2.jpg alt=Orisa-overwatch-2 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Considered by many the best tank in Overwatch 2, <strong>Orisa</strong> excels thanks to her ability to go head-to-head with opposing tanks, no matter who. A feat she manages to perform mainly thanks to her fast-hitting weapon and her Fortify ability, which lowers the damage received by her by a fair margin (40%).</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>She can also work really well against mid-range targets on select occasions, thanks to her Javelin Spin and Energy Javelin abilities. Orisa is also capable of opening up opponents and dealing AoE damage, thanks to her Ultimate, Terra Surge.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>D.VA</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DVA-best-tanks-in-overwatch-2.jpg alt=DVA-best-tanks-in-overwatch-2 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false><strong>D.VA</strong> shines thanks to the straightforwardness of her kit as well as how well she can perform her role, which is focused on securing areas and working as the first line of defense to keep opponents at bay.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>She also excels thanks to her ability to down entire teams with her Ultimate, all while also being capable of performing long-range eliminations, and rushing for the kill. D.VA also has in her mobility one of her biggest weapons, which, when paired with her Defense Matrix skill, can allow you to bait targets and escape various situations efficiently.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>If you plan on using D.VA as your main tank, we highly recommend that you check out our <a href=#>full D.VA guide, featuring an overview of her kit, the best team compositions for her, and more</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Sigma</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Best-tanks-Sigma.jpg alt=Best-tanks-Sigma width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true><strong>Sigma</strong> shines thanks to his ability to constantly and efficiently shield his team, all while zoning enemies out.

You can check why each of them excels in the field below:</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Winston</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Winston.jpg alt=Winston width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>A great pick for new and experienced players alike, <strong>Winston</strong> has one of the most straightforward kits in the game and is able to excel thanks to his ability to shield the party efficiently and deal heavy damage with his Ultimate, Primal RAge. The skill is also a great tool when facing multiple enemies in close quarters and can be a lifesaver when close to being eliminated.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>With that said, his low mid-range damage output and inability to move his shield can make him a niche choice for many matchups.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Doomfist</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Doomfist-best-tanks-ow2.jpg alt=Doomfist-best-tanks-ow2 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>One of the best heroes to use when facing other thanks, <strong>Doomfist</strong> shines thanks to his ability to excel in close combat scenarios and tank advances by using his Power Block ability and his high melee attack range.

With that said, when using her, it is vital that you focus on building up the buff before attempting to perform team skills.</p><h3 class="text-neutral-grey font-display font-bold mb-5 text-title-4" data-cy=Heading data-waterfall=false data-injectable=false>Wrecking Ball</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wrecking-Ball-best-tanks.jpg alt=Wrecking-Ball-best-tanks width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>A great offensive-focused hero, <strong>Wrecking Ball</strong> shines thanks to his ability to both cover the battlefield fast and tank a lot of damage by using his Adaptive Shield ability, which increases his overall health and survivability for each enemy nearby.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Junker Queen</h3><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img title="Best Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2: Ranked Tier List" decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Junker-Queen-best-tanks-overwatch-2.jpg alt=Junker-Queen-best-tanks-overwatch-2 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>One of the new characters who officially debuted together with Overwatch 2, <strong>Junker Queen</strong> excels thanks to her ability to self-sustain herself and deal great amounts of up-close damage. Her biggest strength, whoever, lies in both her passive, Adrenaline Rush, which allows her to heal over time, and in her Commanding Shout ability, which increases both her and her team’s HP.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>With that said, although she does not fare well against other offensive thanks, such as Reinhardt, she manages to clinch her spot as an A-tier thanks to her ability to perform well in many different scenarios, mainly thanks to her melee-focused abilities.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>All B-Tier Tank Heroes in Overwatch 2</h2><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>In the B-Tier, we have heroes, who although capable of really shifting the tide of battle, can be easily countered and need specific compositions and maps to truly excel when playing against high-ranking players.

With that said, his lack of long-range and defensive abilities really sets him back, even after considering the high amount of HO he is able to restore.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Now that you know what are the best tanks in Overwatch 2, don’t forget to also check out <a href=#>how to fix aim and input lag in the game</a>, as well as <a href=#>who are the best support/healer heroes in Overwatch 2</a>.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>You can currently play&nbsp;<strong>Overwatch 2</strong>&nbsp;on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.
