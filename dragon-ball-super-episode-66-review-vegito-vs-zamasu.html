Vegeta and Goku use a technique that they have not used in years.</p><p>Before that happens though, Dragon Ball Super episode 65 ended on a cliffhanger. Goku was doing the Kamehameha wave against Zamasu’s strongest attack. Episode 66 shows us the conclusion of this light show.</p><p>I actually like Goku in this new arc because he doesn’t seem to procrastinate as much as he has in the past. He actually uses his full Super Saiyan Blue power to the Kamehameha wave and this weakens Zamasu a lot. Goku’s attack makes Zamasu’s face turn purple like Two-Face. There is a weakness to him after all.</p><p>Goku still has some energy left in him and starts attacking Zamasu with his fists. He then knocks out Zamasu with a kick to the head while using the Kaioken technique. This makes Goku lose all his energy and he passes out. However, the battle has not ended yet.</p><p>Zamasu is angrier than ever and wants to kill Goku and the others. Gowasu on the other hand speculates what many thought a few weeks ago when Goku Black and Zamasu first merged. Gowasu says that the merged Zamasu may not be 100% immortal after all. This is because only the body of the Future Zamasu was granted immortality. Goku Black on the other hand was still mortal. This is where his weakness lies.</p><img title="Dragon Ball Super Episode 66 Review: Vegito vs Zamasu" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dragon-ball-super-explan-760x428.jpg alt=dragon-ball-super-explan-760x428 width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Gowasu then says that they need an ever greater power than Goku’s Super Saiyan Blue Kamehameha wave to beat Zamasu once and for all. You can guess where this is going. Who is stronger than Goku and Vegeta in Super Saiyan Blue form?</p><p>Goku borrows the Supreme Kai’s Potara earrings and wants Vegeta to fuse with him. Vegeta is hesitant to fuse, but caves in mainly because this is their only chance of winning. Gowasu explains to Goku that Potara fusion between non Supreme Kais only last for one hour. This is why Vegito was able to separate back in the Buu saga.</p><p>There has been a bit of controversy already over this new change in the writing. Back in Dragon Ball Z, it was explained that Vegito separated because the magic wore off inside Buu’s body. They might have made the change in order to make Goku and Vegeta fuse again without explaining why Vegito is not a permanent form.</p><p>After eating some Senzu beans, the two are ready to become Vegito once more. Zamsu does not recognize who they are at first, but then Vegito explains that he is both Goku and Vegeta. After the talking is over, the two merged beings have a great little fight. Zamasu doesn’t seem to be too scared of Vegito, but Vegito is no pushover either.</p><p>Vegito sees that Zamasu is becoming more and more desperate at this point. Zamasu keeps explaining that the current world is corrupt and that mortals should never have been as strong as Gods. He wants to get rid of all mortals and create a new world of his own.</p><p>As this is happening, Bulma tells Future Trunks that the time machine is fixed. Mai gives him back his broken sword, but he wants to join the fight. The writers are making Future Trunks look pretty strong in this arc. He even has the power to make a new sword for himself using his own Ki. There was no explanation on how/where he got this technique from…</p><img title="Dragon Ball Super Episode 66 Review: Vegito vs Zamasu" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/zamasi-two-face-760x428.jpg alt=zamasi-two-face-760x428 width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Vegito is using all of his power against Zamasu and is trying his best to finish the fight once and for all. Again, the writers are doing a little more justice to the Goku character in this arc. He’s not procrastinating like he has done in the past. However, Vegito seems to be using too much power and he separates back into Goku and Vegeta again.</p><p>This might come as a disappointment to Vegito fans. We’ve wanted to see the character come back and he doesn’t even last the entire episode. They apparently used too much energy before the 1 hour time limit was up. Dragon Ball Z fans will moan at this since this rule didn’t apply before. This rule previously only applied to the fusion dance technique with Gogeta.</p><p>Thankfully Future Trunks comes in the nick of time because Goku and Vegeta were about to be killed. He’s using his new Super Saiyan form and he has Ki repaired sword in tow.</p><p>Future Trunks then creates a spirit bomb (don’t know how, he just did) with his sword and own energy gathered by the survivors of Earth. With all the energy, Future Trunks stabs Zamasu and cuts him in half. It appears Zamasu has finally been defeated once and for all! Not to mention it was Future Trunks who saved the day and not Goku. It appears this epic arc is finally come to an end.</p><p>Overall, I thought this episode was good, although revising the rules of the Potata earrings and the short duration of Vegito will annoy some fans. However, the fact that Future Trunks was able to be the main hero puts a smile on my face. I know Goku is the main character, but it was getting tiresome seeing him be the hero all of the time. At least for this Dragon Ball Super arc, he didn’t give the final blow. <a href=#>Click here</a> to see what episode 67 is about.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnlKeuqLvNZpmapJxiwLa8xKtknqiZqLylsYxvbWaqlau2psOMr5ygoaSkere%2FjLOYppmjqnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-66-review-vegito-vs-zamasu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-66-review-vegito-vs-zamasu.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-66-review-vegito-vs-zamasu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-66-review-vegito-vs-zamasu.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-66-review-vegito-vs-zamasu.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdragon-ball-super-episode-66-review-vegito-vs-zamasu.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/elden-ring-iji-location-how-to-find-the-blacksmith-for-blaidd.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/elden-ring-iji-location-how-to-find-the-blacksmith-for-blaidd.html>Elden Ring Iji Location: How to Find the Blacksmith for Blaidd</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/destiny-2-witch-queen-how-to-claim-pre-order-and-deluxe-edition-bonus-dlc.html>Destiny 2 Witch Queen: How to Claim Pre-Order and Deluxe Edition Bonus DLC</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/destiny-2-witch-queen-how-to-claim-pre-order-and-deluxe-edition-bonus-dlc.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
