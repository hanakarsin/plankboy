With that said, according to known leaker SaveYourPrimos, Cyno is known for being extremely intimidating, but beneath that he is a jokester and a card game enthusiast.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Apart from that, Cyno will be a 5-star Electro Polearm user and his Constellation will be Lupus Aureus. You can check out more on Cyno in Genshin Impact’s official Sumeru promotional video, where we can see him sparing against both <a href=#>upcoming Pyro claymore wilder Dehya</a> and <a href=#>Dendro Sword user Alhaitham</a>.</p><p></p><h2 data-injectable=false>Will Cyno be a Support or a DPS?</h2><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>According to many leaks by known leakers such as SaveYourPrimos, <strong>Cyno will be an on-field Elemental DPS</strong>, focused on dealing massive Electro damage. Also, according to a leak revealed by Uncle U and translated by the Keqing Mains Leaks Team, Cyno’s Elemental Skill will be an Electro dash, while his Elemental Burst will, in a fashion similar to both the Raiden Shogun and<a href=#> Arataki Itto’s</a>, completely change his moveset.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Elemental Skill and Burst, Explained</h2><p data-characters=742 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>According to the leaked descriptions of his set, featured in Project Amber as well as to the leaked gameplay revealed by UBatcha, Cyno’s Normal Attack sequence will consist of a series of 4 consecutive spear strikers, while his Charged attack will feature a spiral thrust, similar to Hu Tao’s. His Elemental Skill, Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer, on the other hand, will, as we mentioned above, allow Cyno to propel himself forward while performing a thrust which will deal Electro Damage (CD: 7.5s), while his Elemental Burst, Sacred Rite: Wolf’s Swiftness will allow Cyno to call upon a Divine Spirit, which will possess him and allow him to enter his Pactsworn Pathclearer state, which will completely change his moveset.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>When in his Pactsworn Pathclearer state, all of Cyno’s attacks will deal Electro Damage. While on the state, he will also gain 100 Elemental Mastery and become invulnerable to Electro-Charged damage. The state will last 10 seconds and have a 20 seconds cooldown.</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>You can check out a full showcase of Cyno’s moveset below, courtesy of known leaker UBatcha:</p><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true><a href=#>https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1562416884108214273</a></p><h2 data-injectable=false>All Talents and Constellations</h2><p data-characters=727 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Also according to the leaked descriptions currently present on Project Amber, all of Cyno’s Combat Talents will be focused on increasing his overall damage while on his Pactsworn Pathclearer state, as his Featherfall Judgment Talent will allow him to perform an enhanced version of his Elemental skill while on the state, as well as allow him to deal extra Elemental Skill DMG after performing his Skill three times at the right time. His second combat-oriented talent, Authority Over the Nine Bows, on the other hand, will massively increase the damage of his normal attacks while on his Burst State by 100% of his Elemental Mastery, as well as the damage of his enhanced Elemental skill by 250% of his current EM value.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>According to the descriptions present in Project Amber, all of Cyno’s constellations will be focused on further enhancing his already high damage output and ATK speed, while also allowing him to generate more particles for his team. You can check out an overview of the leaked effect of all of Cyno’s six constellations below, based on the descriptions featured in Project Amber:</p><ul data-found-items=6 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true><li><strong>C1: </strong>After using his Elemental Burst, Cyno’s ATK Speed will be increased by 20% for 10 seconds.
