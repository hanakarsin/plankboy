The 47-year-old has also accepted this and coined the phrase, “Daddy is a state of mind,” during an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Vanity Fair</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Top Characters Portrayed By Pedro Pascal In Movies and TV Shows</h2><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Pedro Pascal’s take on The Mandalorian or The Last Of Us‘ Joel Miller is not the only reason behind his stardom in social media. Throughout his career spanning over 25 years, the actor has almost 60 credits. Here are a few of Pedro Pascal’s best roles till date:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Eddie, the Vampire (Buffy The Vampire Slayer)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Eddie_Buffy.jpg><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>While this is nowhere near Pedro Pascal’s most iconic roles, his take as Eddie in the fourth season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer has been one of his earliest opportunities where he was able to portray his acting abilities. In 1999, Pascal appeared as Eddie in the fourth season’s first episode titled “The Freshman.”</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>In the episode, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) met Eddie at UC Sunnydale, where she briefly interacted with him.

The character appeared in the series’ first two seasons (2009-2011) and was one of Pascal’s first recurring roles, where he shone with his nuanced portrayal of the role.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>According to Pascal’s breakdown of his role in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with GQ</a>, the actor labeled the character as an “a attorney, who was keeping Julianna Margulies’ Alicia Florrick’s husband, Peter Florrick, in jail…”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Agent Marcus Pike (The Mentalist)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Marcus-Pike.jpg><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>In this series, Pascal portrayed Pike, who fell in love with Robin Tunney’s Teresa Lisbon. Though Pascal’s take on Pike was charming and resulted in a brief wholesome relationship with Lisbon, she ultimately chose the series lead, Patrick Jane.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Although Pascal was in The Mentalist for seven episodes in season six, the character of Pike connected with the viewers in the role of a misfortune love interest.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Francisco ‘Catfish’ Morales (Triple Frontier)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Catfish.jpg><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Pedro Pascal played Catfish, a former Delta Force pilot in Triple Frontier. As Morales, the Chile native portrayed a shady yet charming character who is extremely loyal to his friends. In this role, Pascal also shone with his comedic banter.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Furthermore, Pedro Pascal starred alongside Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and his longtime friend Oscar Isaac. This gave the world glimpses of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pascal and Isaac’s bromance</a> throughout the publicity campaign for this film.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Maxwell Lord (Wonder Woman 1984)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Max-Lord.jpg><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Though viewers thoroughly bashed the 2020 film by Patty Jenkins, Pascal’s take on the antagonist Maxwell Lord was one of the highlights. In the albeit poorly-written role, Pascal tried his best to portray the famed supervillain from DC Comics.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>While most of the film was affected by a subpar script, Pascal brought his usual A-game and succeeded in establishing the character as a complex antagonist with a certain level of understandable motivation. Furthermore, Pascal’s Max Lord gave netizens the “Life is good, but it can be better” meme.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Dave York (The Equalizer 2)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dave-York.jpg><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>Like Wonder Woman 1984, Pedro Pascal’s take as the villain, Dave York, in The Equalizer 2 was one of the best highlights of the film. Throughout the film, Pascal went toe-to-toe with Hollywood legend Denzel Washington in their respective roles.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>As a former spy-turned-assassin, York was intense and unhinged. Pascal’s performance maintained the antagonistic vehemence and proved how adept he is at playing a villain.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Ezra (Prospect)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ezra.jpg><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>In this underrated 2018 sci-fi drama, Prospect, Pascal portrayed a prospector on an alien moon.

In their attempt to reach their prospecting site, Cee and Damon meet Pascal’s Ezra and his prospecting partner.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Pascal’s take on Ezra, combined with the thrilling script, made this one of his best roles.

As a rogue and mole agent, Pascal’s Whiskey has one of the best <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">action scenes</a> with his whip and revolvers.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Despite the corny dialogues, Pascal’s suave take on the role made it one of the film’s best parts. Ironically, Pascal’s Agent Whiskey overshadowed Julianne Moore’s Poppy Adams, the big bad of Kingsman 2.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Oberyn Martell (Game Of Thrones)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Oberyn-Martell.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>It is safe to say Pedro Pascal’s appearance in GOT as Prince Oberyn “Red Viper” Martell made him a household name like most of the series cast. Though the character appeared in only seven episodes of season 4, Oberyn Martell is easily one of the fan-favorite characters from the show.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Pedro Pascal’s extremely charming and quick-witted portrayal made Martell one of the most iconic characters from Game Of Thrones. However, the character was brutally killed in his quest for vengeance against the Lannisters.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Javi Gutierrez (The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Javi-Gutierrez.jpg><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>In the film, Nicolas Cage played a fictionalized version of himself, Nick Cage. The actor is offered to hang out with his billionaire fan, Javi Gutierrez. As Javi, Pascal showcases his acting chops in comedic roles. He masterfully portrays a chaotic yet charming superfan who has an LSD-fueled extreme adventure with Nick Cage in their pursuit of developing a film together.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Despite being initially set up as a shady character, Pascal shone through his performance and brought righteousness and a strong sense of morality to Javi.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Javier Peña (Narcos)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Javier-Pena.jpg><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Throughout his career, Pedro Pascal has played several iconic characters on TV. However, his portrayal of Javier Peña in Narcos is one of his best roles. He played the real-life former DEA agent with much charm, gravitas and a strong moral compass.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>Though the character indulged in some questionable choices in his pursuit of Colombia’s Medellín Cartel and the Cali Cartel, Javier Peña always focused on doing the right thing. However, the right thing came at certain personal costs.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Mandalorian/Din Djarin (The Mandalorian)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Din-Djarin.jpg><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>While not his breakout role, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mandalorian</a> is the first time Pedro Pascal played the lead role in a TV series. Though his face is rarely visible in the role, his performance as Din Djarin has made him one of the most fan-favorite characters in the Star Wars franchise.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Furthermore, as mentioned before, Din Djarin’s relationship with Grogu popularized the trope of Pascal’s father figure roles. As Mando, the actor brought an unparalleled sense of heroism with his take on the complex character through his vocal performance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Joel Miller (The Last Of Us)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joel-Miller.jpg><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>Pedro Pascal’s role as Joel Miller in HBO’s highly-appraised ongoing series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last Of Us</a>, is perhaps the best one of his career. The actor brought the complexity of the character to life with an extremely layered and heart-rendering performance.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>In his portrayal of Joel, Pascal does not skip a beat with his performance which resonates with the melancholic and wholesome moments of the acclaimed series. Though the series has just started, Pascal’s take on Joel Miller easily makes it his best role yet.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=false>With Pascal’s portrayal of such iconic characters throughout his career spanning over two decades, it will be quite interesting to see what future roles Pascal will bless with his performances.
